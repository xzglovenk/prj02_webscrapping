65	July 25, 2018	I enjoyed every second of the lion king show I was so surprise and amazed at the same time great show	66	5	Good show	davionsamuels
122	August 29, 2016	This show is amazing. The music is terrific. Highly recommend. To get a better price for the tickets, buy them in their website or their location. Depend on my experience, the best place to sit is start from the 3rd, 4th row in the middle which called orchestra, or in the 1st row in the top called mezzanine 	56	5	Dream come true	SALEISSA
75	September 6, 2016	Two and half hours pass by so quickly. I was there with wife and two kods 8 and 13. They where thrilled as much as me. It is not just marketing,it is worth every dime. Recomending strongly.	20	5	Great show.	Strikan S
19	September 15, 2016	Had set out heart on seeing this show during our week long NY visit and I'm so glad we did. Yes it was expensive but SO worth it. Following advice on here we went directly to the box office about an hour before the show. Sadly there were no $99 seats left for that night. However we were offered excellent seats for the following evening priced at $146 so we just went for it. We were all enthralled with the show from beginning to end. The singing was stunning and costumes just wonderful, the humour ....just everything. Think we must be in the minority of people who were seeing this show for the first time and what a place to see it.	13	5	Just wonderful	C C
49	September 27, 2016	I'am a newbie in Broadway musicals, in fact that was the first one. It was so beautifully made, innovative and aesthetic. I'am now spoiled for any other Broadway show. It is really worth going. The whole show was very professional and a lot of fun to watch. I can highly recommend it.	23	5	It was beautiful	N H
124	October 9, 2016	Amongst all the big ticket, big costume, big cast Broadway musical productions, Lion King reigns supreme. I've seen An American in Paris, The King & I, and a bunch of smaller non-musical Broadway shows, and while Lion King's story wasn't a revelation for me (I'm a grown woman lol and have seen the movies a bunch of times) it's a real beauty of a show put on with a lot of heart. Come see it!	25	5	An NYC Classic	Ealgian
52	October 17, 2016	My adult daughter and I were in New York for a few days. Saw the Lion King on our first night there. The show was amazing! Everything about is was great from the performers to the costumes to special effects! It's a must see for all ages if you get the chance. Would definitely go again!	5	5	Show Was Amazing!!!	TaylorsMom94
101	October 23, 2016	The lion king was a great show. Excellent acting, singing, design, and presentation. The theatre was clean and the seats were comfy. Of course, I recommend sitting up close for a better experience. Since this play is hosted by Disney, be prepared for children to be present.	25	5	Great show	rccampbelljr
40	October 29, 2016	What's New York without a taste of Broadway? An amazing show, magical experience. Well worth every penny; exceptional talent, great vocals, set and visuals. I cannot flaw this show at all. Recommended to everyone visiting New York. Well worth it.	131	5	The Circle of Life! Incredible!	IzzyIsmail
6	November 12, 2016	I took my daughter to see the lion king in November and I was as very disappointed. The music and singing so not good; most the words were unclear.  Unfortunately, I am comparing this cast to the original as I went to see it when it just came out and there is no comparison. Not worth the price. 	3	2	Performance was C-	Ladylovezz
11	November 25, 2016	Absolutely beautiful! Stunning! We were amazed!! The acting and use of props was incredible!!! I and my husband will definitely be coming back here to see this again!! It was truly amazing and awe inspiring!!!	1	5	BEST SHOW EVER ON BROADWAY!!!	Faren R
195	December 4, 2016	We waited to see this particular show until we felt our grandchildren were old enough to appreciate it. The Lion King is a fantastic Broadway experience. Every minute of it was exciting both visually and musically. I would definitely recommend getting tickets for this awesome performance.	91	5	Fantastic Experience 	BrooklynBubbe
370	December 13, 2016	Bought tickets at the Box Office the day before...expensive! The show is outstanding. Singing, dancing, and costumes are amazing. If you enjoyed the movie...see the live show!!!	68	5	Second Time Attending...Great as the First Time	DavidB19922014
5	December 28, 2016	Absolutely loved this show, I went in with high expectations and it exceeded my expectations.  I have seen other broadway shows and this was the most entertaining and fantastical of all so far.	241	5	An amazing spectacle	michelle_pyc
93	January 7, 2017	We paid £500 for a family four to attend which was a huge expense for us. Fortunately it did live up to expectations. The opening scene had me in floods of tears and the attention to detail with the props, scenery and costumes made me understand why the ticket prices had been so high. Our children were mesmerised throughout the whole show and it was one of those magical family moments that I shall never forget. The only reason I didn't give a five was for the vocal quality, particularly with the young Simba who was flat. This didn't spoil a fantastic show though.	67	4	A real spectacle, a must see.	SarahVause
62	January 19, 2017	At last got to see this show and it was wonderful, from the acting, scenery and stage everything was so good. The work behind this show leaves you loving it.	35	5	Amazing show	uel m
11	April 16, 2008	Far from what you see in theatres, beyond the popcorn and the sodas, a broadway show is a must see for anyone visiting new york and this one was no exception. The story line was very childish but anyone could enjoy it, and the music was so well conducted and powerful. I hear its the best show in New York at the moment, so you should really check it out cause it's really something powerful that words can't describe. Of course, no cellphones, camcorders, or even photo cameras, but I'm sure you knew that.	18	5	First Broadway Show experiance, and it was GREAT	yoshiboy700
5	June 29, 2008	My family and I saw the Lion King last week in NYC, and we had been so excited about it. Unfortunately, do not expect the crowd to follow Broadway etiquette as half the crowd will be teenagers or younger. The young children yelling out and the teenage girls sitting all around us were talking the entire show which was completely distracting. Yes, the costumes and music were great, the set was a little less than great. If you decide to go to this show, pay extra to get seats on the floor away from the potential touring groups containing so many chatty teens. And maybe the set would look better from down there. This was my upteenth Broadway experience. We also saw Wicked on this same trip, and it was fabulous.	4	3	unfortunate experience	RHShockey
29	August 2, 2008	"I saw this play with my 2 daughters (10 and 15) and we all absolutely loved it! The play begins with the ""animals"" coming down the aisles. My youngest was sitting on the aisle and the expression on her face was absolutely priceless! I loved everything about it - the music, the costumes (absolutely amazing), the sets, everything! If you go with children, make sure you get one of the booster cushions for them (they were just in a pile in the back of the theater when we went)."	32	5	What a Great Play!!	ChantillyHokieMom
13	October 3, 2008	the most beautiful I've ever seen! perfect!	3	5	wonderful!	Simo23
25	January 23, 2017	What a fantastic show!! I had goosebumps the entire duration and I felt astounded with the amazing costumes. The best show I've seen and if I had the chance to go again I would in an instant. Highly recommended.  The theatre was nice and clean too. Very impressed.	6	5	WOW WOW WOW	Rachel2017X
50	January 25, 2017	Thoroughly enjoyed the Lion King !! The actors were fantastic and kept the audience watching !!! I'd give it a 10/10	28	5	Lion king	Lorraine M
22	January 27, 2017	"While visually astounding, it wasn't necessarily appreciated by our Lion Guard loving 4 year old girl. This was a once in a lifetime experience, but $431 later...I would wait a couple of years if given a ""do over."""	2	4	4 years old maybe a little young for this production 	AngiefromtheUSA
98	January 30, 2017	After many years of saving to cross oceans to see this show on Broadway we feel let down. We pre-booked tickets online expecting something spectacular and what we witnessed felt like a Broadway show fit for the 90s. Please please, renew this show to move with the times, it lacks x factor and definitely needs to take a break to re-fresh costumes, sets etc We really feel the young boy is not a good fit for his character, he was out of tune on copious occasions and never captivated the audience had he been casted right. The positive was the colour and ofcourse the storyline. All the best and please, watch Alladin on Broadway and you will see what we mean by re-freshing this show to give it's audience the best for what they are paying.	53	2	A let down	gcrleigh
96	January 9, 2017	Unbelievable! 3 time seeing the show (2nd on Broadway). The tickets can be expensive but the back 4/5 rows on the top deck over cheapest seats but still pricey at £100+ per ticket.	15	5	A must see!!	A TripAdvisor Member
52	January 13, 2017	My family has seen this play many times but this was our first on Broadway. It is so amazing all the work that goes into the acting and the costumes. There is not a bad seat in the theater. The actors come down the middle aisle and some are up in the upper level. We had an amazing time.	20	5	A play for all ages	Michael S
59	January 14, 2017	The most unique aspect of this musical is the visual: costumes, sets, etc. The songs are great and the story line is great also, but the way they portray the animals and do the scenes from the movie are incredible.	32	5	Lived up to the Hype	Mueller85
311	January 15, 2017	The set and costumes of this show alone are worth the tickets. We sat in Row Y in the two end seats in the Orchestra Section and were able to see the entire set very well.	122	4	Amazing set and costumes!	Andrea G
18	December 31, 2016	We booked the 8pm show for our large group with children. The Lion King was awesome, awesome. After a busy day in the city, our group was very tired but we still enjoyed it all! Costumes were amazing, singing was beautiful. We had great seats upstairs just as you enter in the theatre. Would highly recommend!	3	5	Awesome show!	Keri H
62	January 1, 2017	I was so disappointed by this production. I had heard nothing but fabulous reviews and this was one of two shows we chose to see while in NYC. I am not sure if it were an off night or what but the singing and the overall performance was not what I expected in NYC. I was very displeased about the cost of the tickets not meeting my expectations and we had very good seats. I would certainly make a different choice or do some more review searching before going blindly on what you have heard.	21	3	Not living up to the Lion King	wendylps
105	January 6, 2017	Took the kiddos to see Lion King at the Minskoff Theatre in Broadway. A Broadway show is definitely part of the New York experience and we paid a pretty penny for our tickets. But they were worth it - we were in the 2nd row from the stage and could see the tears & sweat on the actors. This is a great show to take the kids, the acting, music and costumes are totally rocking. My kids who rarely watch TV or movies were actually moved to tears when Simba is mourning his father as an adult. Personally I thought the actress who played Raffiki & the actor who played Mufasa were the best. But Scar was really believable in a negative role as well. All in all, an evening we really enjoyed, even my husband who had scoffed at spending so much on a Broadway show. If you can afford it, get tickets to the first 2-3 rows, the experience is magical. You almost feel part of the show itself.	70	5	Awesome show!	Urmila
171	January 7, 2017	Overall a good show. We just managed to get seats in the very last row center stage but nothing was missed. The audible sound quality was still very good and we could see all the characters quite clearly. We were also fortunate to be sitting in the aisle seat which is what you want as the characters come racing through the aisles onto the stage. The only downside is that the broadway musical was word for word song for song identical to the DVD while I was hoping to see a little variation.	85	4	Good show	BritinBangkok
72	December 14, 2016	A must see for everyone loving musicals. A great show and the second time I see it. Bought great tickets at the door 2 hrs before the show.	14	5	Great show	Jørgen Joakim J
65	December 19, 2016	Even though we were familiar with the story line -- it was told with simplicity but great meaning. Excellent and captivating for all ages...it is a must see in New York! The costumes were phenomenal as were the actors who made the animals come alive. Superb! Bravo!!	15	5	ONE OF THE BEST - BEAUTIFUL MUSIC, SET AND COSTUMES	RoseMCT
22	December 26, 2016	My husband is not a musical theatre fan but even he was really impressed with this show. It was magic from start to finish and although it is many years ago since I saw the movie I could only remeber bits of the story. My husband who had no idea what it was all about was easily able to understand the storyline and all the different characters, so well done to Andrew LLoyd Webber and Tim Rice for their inital genious. The stage and all the moving parts as well as the fantastic costumes made this an absolute delight to watch and I would watch it again in a heartbeat. We had great seats. On the Mezzanine level at the side CC2 CC4 . They were really close to the stage so you could see everything.	4	5	Brilliant	Jane255114
99	December 27, 2016	Some of my favorite parts were the costumes, drums/percussionists in the alcoves, and animal puppetry. But the real highlights are when the cast members emerge from the back of the theatre and bound on stage singing their hearts out! Great cast and production; everyone's hard work has paid off! I will remember this always.	49	5	Down the Aisles	Coley52
119	December 5, 2016	I saw the movie many years ago. I have never seen a Broadway Play and didn't know what to expect. We were impressed with the acting and the costumes. I highly recommend that you go and see Lion King.	50	5	Really Really Good	JMcLauchlin
159	December 10, 2016	This show just blew my mind. I watched it with my childhood best friend and we both left with a wide grin on our faces. Not only is the story a pleasant childhood memory but the performance just made it so much better. The scene and costumes are really elaborate, rich, and colorful. The music is great and the actors even more so. It is one of the more expensive shows on Broadway but it is well worth it. Highly recommended 	50	5	Just like being a kid again	Boyana T
21	December 11, 2016	I've always wanted to see this show, and everyone always raves about it. I'm so glad that we finally got around to seeing it. It was everything that it was promised to be. The set design and costumes are truly spectacular and marvelous. The whole experience is enjoyable for young and old alike! I saw it with my husband for our anniversary, and it made our special day, more special! What a great way to celebrate! I loved it, and would definitely recommend it, as everyone always had to us! I would recommend the center orchestra. We sat on the left side orchestra (R9,11), which is still pretty close to the stage, but I believe you can get a better unobstructed view if you sit in the center. Of course, that would be more expensive, but it's totally worth the experience!	7	5	Spectacular, as everyone always claims!	Nanditha D
67	December 12, 2016	I grew up with The Lion King so being able to experience the show on Broadway was a must for me. The costumes and makeup were fantastic and creative (unlike anything I've ever seen, just mind-blowing), the songs were fun, the set was amazing, and the overall show was excellent! I loved every part of it and the show really brought the movie to life in new and delightfully unexpected ways and was a wonderful experience! Only suggestion I have is to open more concessions so the lines don't get so long. Hakuna Matata!	51	5	Excellent, Creative, Fun!	buzzbabe06
259	November 27, 2016	"We did spend a little extra to get good seats. Ours were along the side of the mezzanine... and were totally worth it. Several times, to our surprise, cast members actually came out right in front of us to perform. The amazing costumes, singing, dancing, and the great story all made for a wonderful evening. Our kids were engrossed the whole time and we were singing ""Hakuna matata"" the rest of the week."	51	5	What a fabulous production	luv2travelMAP
12	November 27, 2016	I am 26 and my husband finally brought me to see lion king the best show ever !!! The vocals and costumes are unique! Seats were awesome	8	5	1 year anniversary suprise	Diana R
123	November 28, 2016	A fantastic show and one that brought back memories of watching the original movie over and over with the kids when they were young. Cast was great - particularly Scar who really nailed it.	10	5	Brought back some memories...	Clint A
14	November 29, 2016	I loved The Lion King. The music, color, scenes, and acting are nothing less than amazing. I bought my tickets about 2 hours prior to the matinee performance. Fair price and great seats. 	1	5	Amazing theater experience	tamarasT9162YY
52	November 15, 2016	Such an amazing performance, the actors are amazing and the costumes stunning. Definitely worth the money as it was such a special occasion.	31	5	Absolutely Fantastic.	Kelly B
35	November 17, 2016	From the moment the first note is played and the African animals walk down the aisles, you are taken to a musical paradise. Catchy songs we all know, amazing choreography and stage management to some truly wonderful acting performances. I would recommend this show to anyone wanting to see a musical on Broadway.	2	5	An Audio Visual feast	Chris T
10	November 19, 2016	Wow Wow Wow, this show was amazing! It is expensive for the tickets, but I am glad I watched this. From the start it was colourful energetic and lots to watch, it had me hooked. Especially loved the play with the shadows.	1	5	Amazing definately worth the money	Natalie A
59	November 21, 2016	Probably the best theater production I've ever seen !! The singing and acting was good but probably the best part of the show was the props and costumes!! It was truly spectacular!! The actor that played Scar was so good, he made us hate him so much with his acting!! And Mufasa was the perfect father !! Definitely worth the money you pay for it... A must see if you come to New York !! 	8	5	Broadway at its best !! 	Menaka G
12	November 4, 2016	The ticket is expensive ( Lowest is 129) but really worth to see it. I saw Aladdin few days earlier, it was good but if I can see only one, I will choose The Lion King. 	4	5	Fantastic	Norineko
1228	November 7, 2016	Wonderful show...fantastic vocals and acting, beautiful costumes and settings. Far superior than the movie, and you'll recognize every song and story. Get your tickets early, luckily I went with a company convention.	202	4	Broadway treat;	Larry M
9	November 9, 2016	It was a very big & enchanting scene ! The theater is great and the costumes and the story are fabulous, a great Disney ! Worth the price definitively :)	1	4	Worth it !	garanceaccorsi
14	November 10, 2016	Amazing performance. If you can would highly recommend seats near the front more expensive but worth it. The cast were exceptional, the whole show was just brilliant. 	2	5	Amazing	Natalie F
22	October 23, 2016	Enjoy the greatest show ever ! Such good memories at NYC ! All the performance was very exciting, the music was great ! As my friends said, it's probably the best show on Broadway ! 	1	5	Piece of art 	Victor T
68	October 24, 2016	An absolute must do! I am so pleased I was able to experience this! I've been wanting to see it at home in London for a long time and decided to take the chance to see it on broadway. It was absolutely breathtaking and would 100% recommend 	7	5	10/10!!	rachelmcclea
54	October 26, 2016	Go !.. run to that box office... get on line.... Buy those tickets. ....its fantastic. For all ages. .... 	81	5	"""Mum and daughter and the king"""	d q
1	October 26, 2016	The Lion King has been one if my all time favorite movies since the first time I saw it. Seeing it on stage was so special for me. It's hard to even describe how much I loved seeing the stage production. It's an experience I'll truly never forget.	50	5	A magical experience!	Symsyd
27	October 18, 2016	The music, the customs, each scene, the characters. All was really amazing. A real pleasure and great joy. The sound was awesome and the whole theater was in perfect tidiness.	3	5	Awesome in every detail	Karina B
392	October 20, 2016	We're not really musical theatre fans, but we really enjoyed this show. Fantastic costumes, good singing & dancing & acting. Loved how the animals and characters came down the aisles - make sure you get a seat on the main floor!	167	4	Great Show	herestoadventures
25	October 20, 2016	Fantastic show for all ages. The performances were top class and the costumes and stage sets were exceptional. This is a must see for anyone visiting New York. 	12	5	Wow...what a show	Clanky79
166	October 22, 2016	You absolutely have to come and see this show - it was spectacular. The whole cast are fantastic and gave so much to their performance. I read a lot of reviews before buying my tickets, and at first I was a little bit gutted when I realised my seats were on the second to back row. BUT... it does not matter where you sit. I had a fantastic view! Do not worry if you haven't managed to get the seats you wanted, all of the seats have a great view. During different parts of the show actors travel around the aisles as well. I cannot recommend this show enough! It was a flawless and emotional performance which received a standing ovation. It's suitable for all ages, even for those who may not usually like the theatre, I swear you'll be converted!	51	5	FLAWLESS!	albcx
106	October 11, 2016	First time going to a broadway show and it was incredible. The young actress playing The lion was amazing. Such a great performance and would definitely go again 	49	5	Amazing shoe	Emily A
119	October 12, 2016	Will never forget seeing the lion king the musical and better still i got to watch it on broadway in new york! Probably one of my most memorable memories (ha) ever. Brilliant performances and all round fantastic show. A must see for all ages 	36	5	Best MUSICAL TO SEE LIVE EVER	lillady24x
16	October 12, 2016	This was perhaps the most amazing show I've seen on stage. I hadn't been to a broadway show before and wow we were left speechless. The costuming was incredible, actors were great and the sets were fabulous. There was always something to watch and not a dull moment during the show. From the first vocals to the last the talent in this show was unbelievable. Well worth the ticket prices.  The Minskhoff Theater was beautiful. I would high recommend this show to anyone visiting NYC. 	2	5	Wow	Stephanie V
29	October 13, 2016	Incredible show. It's EVERYTHING they say it is. It's beautiful, funny, dramatic, innovative, creative. I truly don't even know what else to say but I will never forget it and if they ever tour to my city, I will be front and centre. Plus the gift shop is fantastic.	17	5	Sensational	Sara P
8	September 27, 2016	If you are in NY and you are not going to watch it........  I watch it twice in my life, the first time when I was 12 years old and the second while was 21 years old. I LOVED it ! SO SPECIAL !! SO MUCH CREATIVITY! I WILL COME BACK TO THIRD TIME! 	253	5	AMZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	לינוי ק
40	September 28, 2016	Excellent music, excellent show put by world class artists.  I paid $50 more for each ticket a day later (than when originally I was going to purchase!) ~$750 for four tickets definitely makes this one in a life time experience. Over priced food and memorabilia ($40 for simple T short!)	10	5	Excellent show better plan ahead for good seats and good prices	NoJunk69
180	October 1, 2016	Its a must see show for the whole family there costumes were so insanely awsome the show is put together just perfect. Me and my wife will return for a second show when we visit New York again	20	5	Awsome show for the whole family 	Rene M
107	October 3, 2016	Anybody who is a fan of the cartoon will Love this and to be honest anybody who hasn't even seen the cartoon will probably love it too. All the songs are there. The Characters and Costumes are fantastic. All the seats had a fantastic view. the effects were great. Also I'm slight hard of hearing abut the sounds and music was all crystal clear to me through my hearing aids which hasn't always been the case with other shows.	45	5	One of the best Mucials I have seen.	Steve_In_Ulster
1082	September 16, 2016	This is a very spectacular show, what you expect from a Broadway musical. Specially if you travel with the family. Best customs ever. 	280	4	Great show	MTorre
135	September 21, 2016	The entire show is amazing. The acting is superb, the designs for the animals artistic and stunning, the singing sublime. It made me cry and smile and laugh ...each character impeccably cast and overall the impact is superlative! Don't Miss It !	84	5	Fantastic!	RajHalve
171	September 22, 2016	up to 2 tickets for $30 per ticket. We googled playbill.com rush lottery and it directs you to a site to enter a lottery - well, we won and made the trip up to NYC and saw the show. Incredible, worth it and it is a have to see show. The best part was we paid $60 for 2 tickets, The show is amazing, there really isn't many shows like this. So much going on at all times.	94	5	Try Playbill.com lottery tickets to score	BigTimeTravelFamily
584	September 25, 2016	We had great seats in the P section and an isle seat. BUT there was a big guy in front of us that made clear viewing a real chore. what made matters worse we paid over $350 for these supposedly great seats. In any event the play was dissapointing in that it was so animated with uniforms and moving animal parts that it lost the effect of even close reality. The singing and actual story got lost in the way. Probably much better for kids. We left at the break.	135	3	The Lion King	John R
216	September 10, 2016	Lion King and Wicked are the two best shows ever. Great for kids or adults. I love the message of the Lion King. If you have a choice to see one show make it the Lion King or Wicked	79	5	best show ever	Panic1522
65	September 11, 2016	I saw The Lion King as a kid shortly after it opened almost 20 years ago. Going back as an adult with my husband was an unforgettable experience. The opening number to Circle of Life was breathtaking. I actually got a bit emotional from the visually stunning scene and beautifully sung and performed score, and of course, nostalgia. We got 2 for 1 tickets through Broadway Week, and sat in the second row of the mezzanine. The mezzanine is a great place to sit, as you have a wonderful view of everything that's going on. There were lots of people here with kids too, and they provide booster seats. The kids seemed to enjoy it just as much as we did. Run, run to get your tickets for The Lion King!	25	5	Saw as a kid, and now back as an adult, stunning, mind-blowing, amazing	Lag66
173	September 12, 2016	I've seen this show many times and each time I go I fall in love over and over. Took my kids who loved it as well. There's so much to see. We also arrived late for our show (beyond our control) and were accommodated so nicely. The manager gave us seats at a later show and brought us to our new spot. They didn't have to help us in that way but went out of their way to make the magic of Disney come alive on the stage for my kids. Would recommend to people with or without children - although little ones should be careful as they may be afraid of the scenes with Scar. 	59	5	Amazing performance again and again	kmvw
5	September 14, 2016	Don't know enough adjectives to describe my feelings. From costumes and stage decor to sound and actors; simply an outstanding show. Great overall production. I got to be honest I'm not a big fan of Broadway shows; I was yawning and searching for a place to eat during my Phantom of the Opera visit. So when I was just considering The Lion King show the price was kind of high but hey, it's for my little princess's bday, you gotta do what you gotta do. To make a long story short I set throughout the entire performance with my jaw dropped. We came a bit late, (NYC Traffic) but the staff was great and helped us find our seats quickly, (orchestra, row-n). The theater is in very good condition and the seats were comfortable. The concession stand could use some improvements and I didn't care much about souvenir kiosk since I knew we had to visit the Disney Store after the show. The Lion King show was/is the real diamond. I would definitely recommend and watch it again.	3	5	Unforgetable Experience!!!	Maksim P
28	September 2, 2016	Awesome show! Highly recommend it. It is great from start to finish. I sat in the orchestra section. 	35	5	Awesome	Steven M
75	September 3, 2016	I am physically at the Lion King and have to say I am 98% disappointed. The opening song is very good and the stampede scene is done well. But everything after that is underwhelming. All the acting is mechanical, overly rehearsed, passion less. In some intances, young simbas dialogue overlaps with mufasa and you can tell it becuase it is mechanical. Also the stage sets are bare bone and I mean it. A lame strip of grass here and there and air inflated tree on the entire stage. There is so much more opportunity to redo the stage so u feel u are at a watering hole or savannah. I wonder if sets have been updated since 1997? Also more than half of the time the lighting is soooo dim, you can't see anything. Most of these scenes are with scar....I understand u want darkness but it is overly dark. What's worse is that except for the opening song and akuna matata, the applause in the audience is Luke warm. I suspect this reflects the overall below average quality of the production. I loved loved loved Aladdin, a brightly light, happy play with high production value. The genie was stellar and u could feel the joy or despair in the actors' performances. And it showed because for aladdin therr were standing ovations, loud laughter. But I am soo disappointed with Lion King. I watched YouTube videos also of the Lion King cast singing on planes and at airports and I was so pumped up for a great performance. I was wrong. My heart is broken. I am sad now. Lion king is ruined. I will not return. 	51	2	Profoundly disappointing	inro41
13	September 5, 2016	It' is an amazing play. Don't miss it The choreography, costumes and all play is simply spectacular.	4	5	Excelemt	Anna C
11	September 6, 2016	First time seeing this show. I want wow'd by it but overall good. I think i expected more out of the main character in respect to being more stern with his singing vs soft spoken which made him sound weak	1	4	Broadway	Leticia R
1078	July 25, 2018	We enjoyed watching the Lion King. The music and acting were great. It was a good show for both, children and adults alike.	769	4	Good Show	Wanda C
142	July 27, 2018	My wife has seen this before, and enjoyed it more than I did. Production values are very high as is the acting but the story line is Disney and targeted at a younger age group, and there were plenty of kids in attendance. Unfortunately we arrived late and missed the march of the animals at the beginning, so if you are planning to attend make sure you get there early. The theatre is cold, so take a sweater or jacket. Long lines for food and drink at intermission, so we gave up - eat before you go, or take a goodie bag with you.	18	4	Great production values	Jim L
3	July 29, 2018	The Lion King was MAGNIFICENT!!! We thoroughly enjoyed the Show and it was a fabulous highlight to our NYC vacation. Incredibly creative portrayal of the animals, stunning costumes, very talented cast with their acting/singing/dancing, beautiful music. We highly recommend seeing this outstanding Broadway Musical!!! Lots of fun and funny, along with sweet and touching. AMAZING!!!	3	5	WOW!!!	Perry~Libby~Mad... Z
54	August 2, 2018	Oh my God bloody brilliant it's just like watching the movie a definite dont miss it was a blast. The singing was amazing the production brilliant the time goes in a flash and leaves you wanting more and you walk out singing down the street just brilliant	7	5	Omg what the f... did we just watch	rickgrant1970
1	November 11, 2008	An amazing show, saw this last week and could watch it over and over, I hate flying but would put up with the flight just to see show again. you will not be dissapointed 10/10	1	5	Top Broadway show	slingshotjam
12	August 2, 2009	The show was simply amazing. I would see it again and again if I could.	7	5	I loved it	MimiFan
279	April 22, 2010	We went to Lion King over the Christmas hols. It was one of the most breathtaking and amazing experiences we had - theatrically. The sets, costumes and overall magic of the performance was second to none. we paid about $650 for a family of 4 and it was worth every cent. We have 2 teenage sons who felt just the same as we did. We were spell bound for the entire performance. we went to other shows - but nothing could compare to this. Just go - you wont regret it.	341	5	BRILLIANT	Martina O
17	August 16, 2010	I have seen other musicals on my past trips to New York and this time someone in my group really wanted to see The Lion King. We went to the theater around 1:00 PM (Saturday)and they told us if we waited for a few minutes they would sell us seats that were either cancelled or not sold. We got prime seating for the 2:00PM show at regular prices but considering to be a last minute thing we were thrilled to see such a spectacle. The costumes, music, acting, soul of the show gave me a real high. Thanks to all of those actors-singers, they touched my heart!	5	5	An amazing musical for all ages	Ysigoviajando
11	December 5, 2010	Best of the best! Family friendly. Great music from the movie with a new song added. Fantastic costumes and puppetry. An unforgettable experience.	2	5	Must see musical for families!	TxZacharys
12	March 4, 2011	...very very disappointing. Like another poster has said, audience talked loudly all the way through and used their mobiles with no intervention by any of the staff but the most irritating thing was the child actor playing Simba - he was truly truly awful. Talk about ham acting! Ruined it for us. Wish we had gone to see another show as it cost a fortune to see this one and we left at half time!!!	43	1	Awful...	Biggles11
26	June 22, 2011	Great performance, good singers, standing ovation. No wonder is the No. 1 choice in Broadway. Excellent view of Times Square. Long lines to the concessionary and bathrooms though.	22	5	Spectacular!	ViajeraDC
45	August 12, 2011	Saw the Lion King this past weekend - amazing. It is very similar to the movie - with some differences of course. But the live action version is amazing - very moving and emotional at points. The young kids seemed to enjoy it that were there - there are definitly some jokes that only the adults would get which was great. Overall highly recommended - only problem was the temp in the theatre - it went from nice and comfortable at show time to being beastly warm by the end of the second act for some reason - to the point people were visibly fanning themselves with the programs. But that was just a minor hiccup in an overall great night	9	4	Great show if you like Disney	CNYFiremedic
10	August 23, 2011	I went to see Lion King thinking it was something for kids. I had no ideia how much i would love it. I truly recomend it to adults and kids. Everyone will love it. There is so much work in the stage, the clothes the music, the show is just superb.!	8	5	Superb I loved it so much	Sue1100
57	September 5, 2011	Fantastic musical, songs from the movie and plenty of original songs. The stage and the costumes are breathtaking. A true Broadway experience, should not be missed.	21	5	Great musical	KidIcarus08
457	September 15, 2011	This is the most magical performance I've ever seen! Had to go back a second time just to try to see everything... costumes are had to believe!	118	5	Most Magical !!!	MarySEverett_Wa
72	September 25, 2011	We really enjoyed The Lion King. The costurmes, were amazing. The music was great. It brought back the memories of how much I loved the songs from the movie. The Minskoff Theatre was nice. We had very good seats in the right side balcony. We felt close enough to really see this amazing show. What we did not like was the staff at The Minskoff Theatre. It was our first rude experience with anyone in New York.  It is a shame that the staff have to put a bad feeling on such a great show.	24	4	An amazing show, with rude theatre staff!	dojay111
130	October 10, 2011	No matter how many times I see The Lion King, I love it. But this production exceeded our expectations. The opening scene overwhelmed us with the animals arriving at Pride Rock for the birth of Simba. Absolutely amazing and fabulous costume creations! The sets were also very clever and effective! The music and performers, fabulous! You could tell the entire audience felt them as we did same by their obvious enthusiastic applause. If we could have spent the money to go again during our NY visit, we would have done so with absolute delight. You MUST go!	86	5	Amazing, Fabulous, Absolutely Fantastic!	walkabout55
35	October 18, 2011	The Lion King was our first ever broadway show we saw and we were just blown away! Even though we are grown ups we really liked the show. All the actors were good, but the kids were spectacular! We're already planning to go back to NYC and are going to see many Broadway shows on the next time, that's how much we enjoyed it.	9	5	Amazing show!	Wil-Jam
13	October 23, 2011	The show seems to have fallen a little flat. The staging, costumes, and talent are all up to snuff however the disney magic seems to have faded. The cast was solid and seemed to be having fun, but something was lacking. That magical element that sweeps you into a land of awe never really came to be. I saw the show before and was left FEELING sense of aching beauty and childlike wonder and openness. This time I left THINKING that was o.k. but I am glad it is over... the show left me feeling nothing except ever so slight disappointment.  That said, it is a spectical and worth seeing. Go, enjoy the eye candy, marvel at the creative staging, the solid performance, and the familiar music. 	4	4	Good, not great. Worth seeing.	dineanddish
16	October 29, 2011	Efficient advance booking of tickets. Impressive show. Great vocals and visual effects. Great character acting.	8	4	Lion King	Robert M
40	November 2, 2011	We booked the seats over the internet. These were situated towards the end of the orchestra section and the view was quite good due to the sloping setting of the seating. We did not opt to get discounted tickets as we were told that the show is practically sold out every day.	9	5	One of the best musicals I have been.	Nick F
29	November 4, 2011	Loved the puppets and music but liked Uk version better - no so many corny jokes 	33	3	Too much American Panto	lbl16
127	November 5, 2011	Wonderful musical that we have seen several times in London before. Perfect for everyone in the family. We booked tickets in advance via Ticketmaster, recommended!	53	5	Wonderful musical!	CamillaLejon
38	November 7, 2011	The show was fantastic. No matter what your age you will enjoy the singing, and amazing costumes. Well worth a visit.	32	5	Excellent family show	patricia_knapman
9	November 7, 2011	I must say I'm not a fan of most broadway shows often finding them too cheesy for my taste. The Lion King was a definite exception. The show is tastefully done and has incredible music and dances. It appeals to all ages and I would recommend it to anyone.	3	5	The best broadway show out there	carolinacastro90
12	October 29, 2011	This broadway show was the highlight to or New York trip, other than the 911 memorial it was probably our favorite	7	5	Awesome show	Carri45
112	October 31, 2011	Amazing musical. Saw it 10 years ago in Sydney - still incredible 2nd time around. Booked tickets 4 months in advance so seats were great. Note - TKTS (cheap tickets) never gets Lion King so book ahead and you won't be disappointed! 	58	5	If you only see one musical, make it this one	Hkj00
21	October 31, 2011	I am not a theatre fan, however I thoroughly enjoyed the Lion King, a great night out!	21	5	My first show	Michael F
7	November 1, 2011	We had front row seats for my 6 year old son's first Broadway show. It was unbelievable!	1	5	Loved it!	worldnreview
9	October 23, 2011	My kids loved it. As most shows in NY the talent was excellent and deep. MY kids loved it:)! We saw it again recently and the kids (7 & 5) said NY was better:)	16	4	Great Show in a Tired Theatre	BizTravelerDeluxe
108	October 25, 2011	This show is brilliant, the costumes and talent is exceptional.	67	5	Amazing Show	amandar044
7	October 26, 2011	Performance was great-- much fun, and worth the money. HOWEVER, after it was finished --and we all had that great, magic feeling-- we were instructed to again take our seats. We did so, and were then (for nearly five minutes) hit up for donations to AIDS and Breast Cancer charities. Ruined the experience. Theater of this type is for escape from the tragedies of life --and we all have them. Very poor form, and as noted, all of the magic of the moment vaporized in a flash. 	4	1	Shakedown for Cash at close ruined the magic	NoCalVisitor
8	October 28, 2011	If you pick one show it has to be this one. Perfect in every way and gives you that feel good factor.	2	5	Loved It	SassieSue
4	October 18, 2011	Lovely theatre and great show. Right on times square. Take your own water as drinks are expensive.	1	4	Expensive but worth it	ShellyLynch2
4	October 20, 2011	IT´s simple to say: AMAZING i enjoy it with my daugthers and was unforgettable for us	1	5	Amazing	Hugo D
60	October 21, 2011	Not my favorite broadway show (Wicked), but overall very good. It must have been extemely difficult to imagine converting a cartoon movie about animals into something that could be played by humans on stage, but Disney pulled it off brilliantly.  The costumes are terrific and the actors are well suited. It stays pretty much exactly to the story of the film, so there aren't too many surprises. It's a long show (3 hours) so I was surpirsed at how many children there were, but they all seemed to handle it well.	59	4	Great costume and innovative transition from film to stage	Dave_O_the_World
36	October 22, 2011	This show was fantastic. Teenage children loved it as much as the adults. Bought the tickets 1 day before the date on ticketmaster...a whole row opened that morning as I had been looking for tickets for 2 days prior. Got great seats, paid full price but worth every penny!	9	5	BEST TIME	drosiewh
46	October 11, 2011	This was a fantastic show but also excellent for children. The whole show was superb and is a must for anyone who has the opportunity and budget to see it. The costumes and method of making animals realistic was great. Highly recommend.	27	5	Must see performance	Stuart S
7	October 12, 2011	The costumes were amazing. I was thoroughly engaged throughout. It was one of those rare experiences in entertainment where you didn't want the event to end. Highly recommended though the cost is hard to justify.	1	4	Teriffic show - especially for kids old enough to appreciate it...	Joe C
33	October 15, 2011	"You go with the feeling ""i've seen the Movie with the kids..."" but it was an unexpected pleasure that was performed with such joy and enthusiasm. You could tell the cast was having a great time. We've been to it three times now, taking someone new each time. A must see while in the City!"	7	5	Unexpected delight..	scbuilder1
23	October 16, 2011	I brought my mom and sister to see this show in NY since I had already seen it in Chicago and loved it. I guess the expectation for Broadway shows is to be the best, but I thought the one in Chicago was just as good. The Minskoff Theatre is right in the heart of Times Square and the attendants there were very accomodating. As soon as we walked in they noticed my mother walking with a cane and they immediately escorted us to an elevator and seated us before the doors even opened, so we really appreciated that. The opening scene and costumes are spectacular! It's hard to describe, but the actors make it believable that you are looking at animals without making it cartoon-like. The whole show is very entertaining and very funny at times for any age.	15	5	Very Entertaining	cjorchid
2	September 26, 2011	The stage work was terrific; seeing how they adapted the cartoon effects to live stage. The storyline, dialogue etc. was exactly like the movie which would be o.k. if you really liked the movie.	3	3	Great Staging and puppetry. Story and dialogue same as the movie.	ROAMINGNUMRL
213	October 2, 2011	A definite must see when on Broadway. We saw this in LA and it just was not the same.	134	5	A festival for all senses	steve b
13	October 5, 2011	The Lion King on Broadway was something that my wife and i were looking forward to seeing when we booked our trip and we were not disappointed. The whole thing from start to finish was amazing. The set and the costumes were stunning. The storyline most people will know as it takes from the film. The cast were amazing especially the character Rafiki. A really enjoyable evening and a must see when in New York.	6	5	One of the best musicals	philshadwell
87	October 6, 2011	Seen the Lion King on a Sunday night. Ordered tickets online months in advance, and got 1st row, middle of Mezzanine. Production was excellent. I've seen the movie many times before with our then younger children, so the dialogue was pretty much as with the movie. To me, I was having a little bit of a hard time with the human performers operating the smaller animal appendages, but my wife absolutely loved it. Theater was great, from a location and performance standpoint.	31	4	Wife Loved It, I Thought it was Very Good	MNTraveller45
4	September 15, 2011	"actors and actress are awesome, music was nice I love Ska, he is a great actor. ""can you feel the love tonight"" it wasn't I expected, they can do it better ! all in all loved it !!!! YOU GUYS'RE BORN FOR THIS !!!"	2	5	AWESOME	pigpig66
77	September 17, 2011	This has to be one of the best shows on Broadway, just fantastic... With humour thrown in. I went with my daughter and I must say we enjoyed every moment of it . You get drawn in to the whole story, as it is so well done. Fantastic actors and the animals are just unbelivable.. Just a Must be to your things to do in New York.	49	5	Amazing	cludasdulac
10	September 21, 2011	Music, actors, atmosphere, orchestra - just pure perfection. Without a doubt best musical I've ever been. Highly recommend to everyone.	2	5	Best musical ever	NoPulp
20	September 21, 2011	Musical is very interesting with lots of music from the cartoon. One of the best shows in history of Broadway.	6	5	One of the Best Shows	sashokchat
57	September 6, 2011	The 2.5 hour long show was very engaging, even for our preschool kids. The drinks at the snack bar were outrageously expensive and terrible to taste.	47	5	Great show	Cashewfeni
103	September 10, 2011	There is a reason why this is one of the longest running shows on Broadway. Good luck finding cheap tickets though, let alone any good seats!	79	5	Amazing show	TeamTam
197	September 12, 2011	You feel grateful to be in the audience of this spectacular show. So creative and emotional. Pure magic for all ages. Go see it!	135	5	Grateful	sspc
55	September 13, 2011	"I am not a professional show reviewer so I will just say what is in my heart. The Lion King is a superbly presented musical. A person becomes so caught up in the story that at times you forget that some of the characters are puppets being worked by performers. The ending when the song ""The Circle of Life"" is sung, I swear, many, many people had tears in their eyes.  This was one show that was worth every penny of the ticket cost and I highly recommend it for all people of all ages."	20	5	Unbelievably beautiful	cindy k
77	August 24, 2011	The Lion King was exactly what one would expect from a Disney show, but for an outrageous price. I don't quite think it was worth it. Children made up the majority of the audience, and it might be a good thing to go to if you want something to do with children, but anyone over the age of ten should skip it. I think that Disney shows on Broadway generally do well many tourists come to see it because of the Disney brand and because of their familiarity with the show, but I really don't think it's the best thing Broadway has to offer. Yes it's fun, but it doesn't have the complexity of, say, a Sondheim show. Overall it was ok. I had a nice time, but I wouldn't do it again.	26	3	Good, but too much like an extension of a show in Disney's parks for the Price	autumn88
238	August 25, 2011	The set design and costumes are genius and incredible. Along with the Lion King music, you will see a show that is mezmerizing! Equally enjoyable for adults and children, the popular tunes are known to all. Really worth it to get Orchestra seating as it really is captivating and you want to take in everything, especially if you have kids with you. Ideal for ages 6 and up, as younger children may have a difficult time identifying some of the characters from the Lion King animated movie. Just so delighful, it's a happy and fun play to see.	110	5	Excellent music, set design and costumes	elitetrav
34	August 30, 2011	I thoroughly enjoyed The Lion King. It was my first Broadway play ever, and it did not dissapoint. The tickets were pricey, but the show was spectacular. All of the singers were fantastic and extremely talented. I would love to see it again. I recommend it to people of all of ages.	14	5	Excellent Broadway Show!	sherful2008
4	September 4, 2011	Great way to introduce young people to the Theater! We were just amazed at the costuming and the music. Made a wonderful memory taking a friend to Broadway for the first time!!! Don't miss this one!	2	5	Unbelievable! Wonderful! Fabulous!	Rhubie
82	August 13, 2011	There are not enough words to describe the greatness of this play. It is fantastic, it will surprise you every second. Incredible production and acting. Definitely a MUST SEE in Broadway!	35	5	JUST AMAZING!!	NicoTerk
105	August 16, 2011	A must see for those with children/teenagers... brilliant show! The costumes, the makeup, the cast.... wow!!!!! however, do not buy your tickets at the hotels. The prices at the hotels are double that at the box office.	29	5	Brilliant!	RKM466
224	August 19, 2011	I was somewhat disappointed. After all the hype, I enjoyed the staging but didn't think it was the greatest thing ever. As we all know, TLK story is weak at best and the songs are only so-so. I suppose no amount of imaginative costumes can take the place of a good story and good songs.	108	4	interesting but where's the story	EBPandDSP
13	August 21, 2011	The Lion King was just an amazing play to see for all ages. Not to loud, great location and food and a family fun trip. TIckets were affordable easy for wheel chair access. Just a great fun trip for all ages	6	5	Lion King blew me away	WON2301
70	July 9, 2011	WOW... all I can say is WOW ... The theatre is located at Times Square... and has all the Broadway feel that I had expected.... The Sho was wonderful... and an experience of a lifetime	42	5	Fantastic Show	TravelerMontreal
17	July 24, 2011	This is a definite must see when visiting NY!!! The opsning scene alone was outstanding! The acting was great, scenery was breathtaking, even the acting of the little kids was top notch. It was exciting from start to finish and I would love to go back and see it again.	6	5	Amazing Show!!	cruisingal09
19	July 29, 2011	I go see plenty of shows when I can and I was absolutely facinated by this show. Besides recognizing the songs and the story of the show, it is facinating so see how they bring the characters to life. Worth every penny of it. I will recomend to sit in orchestra and in the middle rows for best views.	18	5	Best Worth For Your Money	cgoicochea
28	August 7, 2011	I love a good deal and was bummed when I found out there were no reduced tickets for this show. I could have gotten almost any other show discounted, but I thought this would be so memorable that I finally bit the bullet and ordered tickets from the theatre. I got face value seats on the front row of the right side of the mezzanine (BB- there is no AA). I wanted my 11 and 13 year olds to remember this. They both Loved it and the show included a few animals that came to the Mezzanine and sung right in front of them (the reason there is no AA). I am so glad that i didnt settle and got this show.	15	5	WORTH THE PRICE!!!	Rambrozy
21	March 19, 2011	We really enjoyed the Lion King. The costumes and set are amazing, the songs are great and the cast are all very impressive. Its a great one for all the family - we were 3 adults and all loved it. I would definitely recommend it.	90	5	Amazing show - exceeded my high expectations	dublin18
22	April 1, 2011	"Really great show, even my husband liked it! He's not a ""theatre goer"" and he found it very entertaining. Would recommend to people of any age."	14	4	Amazing show	LozMov
70	April 20, 2011	The Lion King overall was a pretty good Broadway Play filled with awesome talent, songs and effects. It follows the actual story pretty well adding only changing it up a little, but not to much. The actors/actresses were very good and played out there parts very well making no mistakes. In all it was just a fun play to see.	32	5	A Great Play to See!	kirkbngr
13	May 30, 2011	Went to see production with my mother and teenager son who just graduated high school. My mother had never seen the movie but absolutely loved the show! We were mesmerized with all of the sights and sounds and were 3 rows from the front. Great view. Every actor in the production protrayed their character with class and emotion. It is truly a work of art to be enjoyed by the young and young at heart. Everyone can relate to this show.	13	5	Absolutely awesome!!	Persephone R
1	January 12, 2011	From disney,go they took me to Ticketmaster, Then I had to choose Will Call option for delivery to take my tickets from Argentina, only way. I bought them with my son's credit card and now I have to take my son or the credit card to New York . They say it's the only way to have my already payed tickets.	195	5	Ticket master Will Call a nuisance	mergzBuenosAires
26	January 26, 2011	I had the opportunity to see this show in April 2010 while in New York City. It was my first time visiting the city and I'm glad we chose this show to see! The costumes and props were beautiful. I've always been a fan of the animated version, but to see it up close in vibrant colors was just overwhelming. I was bought to tears sitiing there in awe...LOL! After the performance, the cast was available for photos. The theatre's staff members were also most helpful as well. I'm planning on visiting Vegas soon and will check out the show there as well.	17	5	A Must See When in NYC	BeautifulMind504
96	February 9, 2011	Really fun play. It is definitely a show for kids, but one I can say adults would enjoy just as much. The costumes and set/ props will literally blow your mind. The singing is spectacular. I knew the story very well, but still enjoyed every single minute. The theatre is small, so I think any seat would be great. We had the cheapest level and were able to see everything! Maybe try to get more towards the middle and on the upper level (so you can really see the stage), but otherwise, I don’t think there is really a bad seat. I would recommend this show for all ages/ genders, etc- GREAT performance!	59	5	AMAZING show! The costumes and sets are SPECTACULAR!	TaryninSeattle
27	February 16, 2011	This is my third time watching the Lion King, but my first experience in New York. I have watched the Lion King two times in London and both shows were great. The New York performance was disappointing and the audience loud and talked through the performance. There was even a fight during the performance with an audience member who was being rude and was talking during the show. Staff were not on hand to control this situation. The acting and singing was just average and I wished I had spent my time and money on another show. Maybe I just got unlucky, but when they are charging over $150 for one ticket, the show should be great, for me it was just OK. If you have seen the show in London, don`t bother seeing it in New York, you will be left feeling disappointed. See another show.	78	2	Didn`t meet my expectations!!	AussieTraveller555
139	August 24, 2010	"I know we're in the minority but paying more than twice the price for a shorter and rushed version of Londons excellent effort was a bit of a let down. This was the 4th time watching the show and the first on Broadway. Maybe we expected too much but find it had cut out a few parts of the show including a whole song made us feel short changed...especially at over $500 for the family which were not even the ""premium"" seating. Save your money and if you can, watch in London."	133	3	Good, but expensive and not as good as London	BournemouthFan
52	September 9, 2010	Having booked up our tickets months in advance - we got front row centre mezzanine seats which certainly added to the show! The theatre was very nice, although we paid $8 for 2 bottles of water before going in. The seats were very spacious and a fantastic view. A fantastic night out!	17	5	Amazing show	SianDaviesCole
26	September 25, 2010	Lion King has it all: Any other show would pale in comparison. It was funny in places and yet brought tears to my eyes for just the shere genious of it all. The set was beautiful, the costumes amazing, the musicians so talented, the dance so unique. I chose this show for the family atmosphere, and it was perfect. My husband had never seen a broadway show before, and he loved it.	26	5	Highlight of our trip	Merry61
40	October 14, 2010	Go see this, the costumes & stage effects are breathtaking. The theatre is a nice small size so good views of the stage. Good for adults & children : ) The view of Times Square from inside the theatre is excellent too.	35	5	Amazing costumes & staging	BecciLeeds
13	May 25, 2010	I travelled to NY over xmas 2007 and having come from the UK i can honestly say no one does xmas better than the Americans! Anyway i was lucky enough to purchase centre front seats on the balcony prior to coming to NY (£120 per person) during xmas week! The show was magnificent - no other word can describe it. The costumes, the music, the songs was just amazing. Highly recommend it if you can afford it.	12	5	It should be illegal not to visit Broadway during a visit to NY	ramin3
28	June 21, 2010	I have seen The Lion King show twice in London and once again just recently in New York and it is still AMAZING!! My husband and I have just returned from a trip to New York, Niagara Falls & Toronto, while celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary. My husband had not yet seen the show and so as a surprise i booked the tickets on line before we went. I could not stop my excitement knowing that it was going to be an amazing show with that powerful opening scene with the animals coming down the isles and which amazingly made you feel part of the show too. The whole show is just fantastic, with great songs, excellent performers & superb costumes. And seeing it on Broadway made it that more extra special. I fully recommend seeing the show, you will definately not be disappointed.	23	5	EXCELLENT!!	MandyCardiff
3	July 5, 2010	"After deliberating for months about which show to see whilst in NYC myself and my friend decided to book tickets for the Lion King. We booked Via Ticketmaster and used the will call option which was great as I got to actually select the seats I would be sitting in as Ticket Master has a cool venue seating planner. I selected the 4th row from the front on the left hand side of the orchestra seating and we paid about £100 per ticket $276. We collected the tickets up at the box office around an hour before the show started and then had cocktails in the Marriott at $20 a cocktail but worth it for the view. I was like a small child all exited for the show to start and to my amazement when it did the opening song ""Circle of Life"" all of the animals actually went right passed me on to the stage. The show was very moving even though you would not expect it and the lady that plays the crazy monkey Wow! what a set of lungs she has on her totally amazing and well worth the money. The puppets were used very well and the whole production of the show was very well thought out especially since there are a few scenes where you are looking around at the activity not on the stage but actually around where you are sitting. The actors are brilliant and play the parts well. I will defiantly be back next year for some more Lion King!"	4	5	Amazing to say the least!	carlyhenzell
6	July 27, 2010	I went to see this show with my Mom and sisters not so long ago... I absolutely loved it! The costumes, the music, the suppetry and especially the acting. Wow is the word to describe this show! The show last a good 3 hours with the intermission and not one minute of it was dull. The Lion King is a MUST SEE for individuals of all ages! You won't be disappointed. I would go again and again!	12	5	First and best Broadway show, I am sure.	valthetraveller
18	October 10, 2009	"Fantastic show. I have seen many shows over the years, but this is definitely up there as one of the best I have ever seen. It was absolutely excellent and had our attention from curtain up to curtain down. there was no point when we thought ""this bit isn't as good"" or where our attention wavered. The costumes were inventive and excellent, the performance was captivating and the singing voices, especially of the lady who played Rafiki, gave me goose bumps as she sang as her voice was so powerful. I wouldn't hesitate to go again and would recommend it to everyone, old or young. I went with my daughter of 17 and we both really loved it."	155	5	One of the best shows i've ever seen	PRprofessional
11	March 21, 2010	"We bought tickets for full price because we wanted to make sure that we had tickets before we got to New York. There are places to get tickets for cheaper (TKS is one). We sat in the last row of the theatre and could still see perfectly. It was an amazing show. You almost forget that the ""animals"" are people....it's that good. Definitely a must see."	5	5	Amazing	thehuddys
3	January 13, 2010	we enjoyed it greatly, the whole family had a good time (not sure it is appropriate for very young children though). The customs are amazing, the performance is enthusing, the whole show was quite an experience. I got tickets for a price that's a bit cheaper on lastmninutetravel website, but I am sure if you go on TKTS lines, you might get even cheaper tickets. at any case - Go See!	3	5	great show	SamIAm012
2	April 5, 2010	We went to NYC last week on a special trip - my son Joshua was granted a wish by the Wishing Star Foundation (they grant wishes to kids with life-threatening medical issues), and The Lion King production donated our tickets. We not only had wonderful seats just a few rows back from the stage, but they orchestrated a before-show backstage tour for our family. One of the assistant producers (and understudy for several of the characters), Thom Christopher Warren, showed us the set, the costumes, the intricate headpieces, and introduced us to some of the actors and production staff members. He explained the dream behind the show, the intricate puppets and headpieces (they're WAY lighter than they look!), and how some of the animal costumes worked (the elephant, for example, has four people manuevering inside it at one time!). He even took me into the dressing room and let me log onto his own computer to check my email for our confirmation number when the Will-Call window couldn't find our tickets. During the intermission, Thom brought Joshua a Lion King poster signed by all the castmates, and a numbered artist rendering of Simba's costume - what a wonderful and thoughtful gift! Josh was so happy and grateful. The tour and the show were amazing. No review can adequately describe what an amazing production The Lion King really is. It was breathtaking. If ever in NYC, go see it, you won't be disappointed! A special thank you to Thom and Marquis for making our tour special!	1	5	Words can't describe this experience!	YewNork
103	December 4, 2008	This show is simply brilliant!!! From the minute the cast walked down the aisles to the stage in their (fantastic) costumes til the curtain went down, I sat transfixed with goosebumps & a lump in my throat. You have no idea how good this show is til you actually see it for yourself.    We were in row V & I thought we might be too far back but the seats were perfect.   Brilliant, BRILLIANT performance, the highlight of my trip! The kids who play young Simba & young Nala are worth a special mention.	69	5	Amazing	sarahkScotland
16	March 4, 2009	"My wife and I have been to several Broadway shows and absolutely loved The Lion King. There are shows that have better acting, and there are some shows that have better dancing and singing, but when you combine all of the elements together, this show is the best ""production"" on Broadway."	11	5	Best Production on Broadway	Ernie_Raffles
34	June 22, 2009	This was our first visit to a show on Broadway and our first time seeing The Lion King. We booked several months in advance so had perfect seats about six rows from the front in the middle. For some reason tickets are quite a lot more expensive than visiting the theatre in London’s West End, but in my opinion worth it for the vastly more comfortable seats alone! Right from the opening scene I was totally mesmerised - everything about the production, the music, the costumes, the choreography was spot-on. Loved absolutely every minute of it and didn’t want it to end.	36	5	Mesmerising	DaveHas
345	July 9, 2009	By far, this is my favorite presentation ever. I will not be repetitive, as others have already said about the performance. What I have to say is: SPECTACLE IS SPECTACULAR!!! I've been twice and cannot expect to watch again. Costumes are well characterized and actors are of excellent quality. Singers are the very best and Orchestra with a particular DRUM section really impress. Do not miss it!	214	5	My favorite presentation ever!!!	LESIUS_LENHADUS
216	November 8, 2011	No need to say any more, great music, great story just loved it	186	5	Just loved it	Bob-Carol-Pinjarra
153	November 15, 2011	Makes for a great evening out. Good music, great costumes, very high production values and a heart warming story.	50	5	Stunning Production	Scrippsmater
196	November 18, 2011	The players might get tired of the same ole thing but seeing them never gets tired. Go often.	107	5	Test of immortal greatness	travaillour
230	November 22, 2011	I'm not a lover of Broadway shows but there are a few I have seen and loved them all based on my wife knowing what I would like. The Lion King was absolutely fantastic and worth the expensive orchestra seats for a once in a lifetime experience. Not sure how or why other parents would pay for 4 seats in the orchestra section for kids under 9...the night can easily cost over $1K! But hey to each their own. In any case the show was amazing and the actors and actresses really impressive.	98	5	So good!	MiseryEE
201	November 24, 2011	We only had time to see one Broadway show when we were in New York recently. We picked The Lion King and weren't disappointed. The production was energetic, colourful and vibrant. The staging was fabulous - particularly the way the great migration was portrayed. 	134	5	A Lion of a Production	Watsonsgotravelling
43	November 28, 2011	Yes, it is as good as everyone says it is. Yes, it is worth the high ticket price...people says tickets are tough to get but if you are flexible...go by the ticket counter in the theater and you can sometimes get same night tickets...sit near the aisle--the BEST VIEW for the introductory animal parade!!!!!!!	40	5	Powerful...	Yalie97
66	November 29, 2011	Our first time taking our almost 6 year old daughter and she was on the edge of her seat. While my husband and I have seen this multiple times, it did not disappoint. Such an excellent production!	96	5	Always perfection!	RedCharleston
25	December 3, 2011	During Thanksgiving week, my husband, daughter and myself really enjoyed The Lion King on Broadway. The costumes were fantastic and the play held our attention continuously. Photos are not allowed, so there is no need to take your camera unless you want a photo of the marquee. Each of us had a diferent favorite character. For transportation, it was easily reached by the subway. We would recommend it to others.	35	4	The Lion King at the Minskoff Theatre had Great Costumes	Charlene51
30	December 5, 2011	Love the music and the pagentry! The most amazing pagentry I've ever seen and I've seen most of the shows on broadway...	11	5	Amazing Pagentry	RMR12
26	December 9, 2011	The Lion King blew my mind. It was incredible - the costumes, the set, the music, the actors. Everything. This is a Broadway show worth seeing.	14	5	SEE IT.	Jaime M
12	December 12, 2011	Great show with fabulos coreography and decor. No goose bumps moments from the lead singers.	4	5	Fantastic show	Jonas B
36	December 15, 2011	OMG this was incredible! I cannot gush too much over this! The stage, the settings, the props, the make up, the costumes, the music, the acting, OMG EVERYTHING! I dont care how expensive it is, this is a must see for anyone regardless of whether your a Disney fan, or a fan of musicals, or a fan of Broadway.	33	5	DOOOOOO IT!!!!!	kizzarina
12	December 19, 2011	Was done very well. We were amused the entire time.	9	4	Excellent...	Cremdella
87	December 26, 2011	I saw this show 3 times - that says it all! The moves of the cast members make you believe you are actually seeing the animals they portray.	45	5	Amazing	Cherie F
23	December 22, 2011	"I have seen the movie ""The Lion King"" so I know how the story goes, but it was just awesome from the opening scene all the way through to the end. I have also been to other broadway shows, but none as good as this one!!! Everything from the costumes to the special effects was amazing, and I would go see it again. You definitely WILL NOT be disappointed."	13	5	So amazing that I cried during the opening scene!	ilovechristmas1121
165	December 28, 2011	The Lion King is a great show, I've seen a few times over the years. Great for kids and adults. 	66	5	A NY must see	GdayNY
39	December 29, 2011	After seeing numerous shows on Broadway, I was a little dissappointed with this show. It didn't have the same excitiment as the other shows. I wouldn't recommend it very highly.	14	3	Not what I expected!	Miamihog3
96	December 30, 2011	My wife has seen the Lion King in Las Vegas and fell in love with it. She has been wanting me to see it forever and we finally had our chance. I'm very excited to say it was an amazing show.  The location is perfect - Really close to Time Square - we stayed in Time Square and actually walked there and back the night of the show. So, if you are staying in Time Square - no worries, you will be fine walking.  The minute you step foot into the Theatre, you are treated well and the staff is extremely helpful. Our seat we upper level in the front row, located in the middle. The show itself was amazing. I don’t want to give it away, but the effects and performers did a wonderful job. I want to talk more about it, but you'll have to see it. I will say, the performers were everything - the moving grass to the animals...just amazing! This was my first time seeing the Lion King and a musical - I'm sold and will join my wife anytime if they are all like this one. I did enjoy the break, you can get a drink and some food in-between sets.	65	5	One Word - Wow!	kevkid33
8	December 30, 2011	So different to any other show I have seen. The music, the voices, the costumes, the actors. 10/10. Would definatley go to see again if I was back.	3	5	Amazing	Charlsie78
56	December 31, 2011	Really impressing show! could be cheaper so more people would be able to watch.	27	5	Amazing	flafreire
35	December 31, 2011	I honestly didn't think I would like it as much as I did.. this show was fantastic!	12	5	AMAZING!!	afanofthebeach
34	December 28, 2011	My daughter (10) loved it. The lion king had wonderful artists and dancers. It is not your typical musical. Unexpected and exciting! Downside: some of the singers were not that strong. 	30	5	If you have kids, watch it!!!	trip4mom
21	December 29, 2011	I first saw Lion King when it first came to Broadway with a friend. I loved it so much, I ordered tickets to take my children. SInce the actors come down the isles dressed as animals singing to the audience, I waited 9 months to get tickets on the center isle about 5-7 rows from the stage. When family from Germany, with limited English, wanted to visit NYC and see a show, I decided Lion King was the show to see. The costumes are so great, you only see the animals, not the actors. The music is so moving, I bought the CD and listen to it in the car. The translation from screen to stage is amazing -I would say more but don't want to spoil it...you just gotta go see it to believe it. Writing this, I want to go back!	7	5	Saw Lion King 3 times- gotta go see it to believe it.	getpackingNJ
11	December 29, 2011	LOVED this one. It may be my favorite. Cannot believe what they did with costuming. Music was extraordinary. GO TO THIS SHOW! 	34	5	FANTASTIC SHOW! Not just for kids!	speedyg103
47	December 29, 2011	I have seen The Lion King 8 times and I just purchased my ninth ticket. I usually see a performance once every 3 months. Its magical. Have seen it with my great nieces and nephews, my grandchildren (twice), friends, just about anyone who will go with me so I don't have to go alone. While everyone knows the story to see it memorialzed in dance, music and song is glorious. For children the afternoon performance is advisable especially for small children after a nap. Everyone will just love it!!	30	5	This Was My Eight Performance	jufi788
353	December 27, 2011	If you have seen the movie, you know what is going on, the costumes are great, but not really the reason to see a Broadway Show.	78	3	Just overrated	srcesq
264	December 27, 2011	Spectacular sets, amazing costumes, fabulous singing and dancing. You and your family will be mesmerized by the staging of this Disney  fantasy. Worthy of all the rave reviews, loved every minute. Perfect for every member of the family regardless of age.	97	5	Lion King - A once in a lifetime musical fantasy	Barry K
6	December 27, 2011	Saw this twice will never forget the experience.... This is exactly like the movie and the kids loved it	2	5	Great Show	Miiszcupcake
58	December 28, 2011	Nothing like it you will ever see! Kids from 0 - 104 years of age will enjoy	13	5	A must See	Leslie M
18	December 23, 2011	I love Lion King. I know by heart every line! I had to go as I am such a fan, but I was overwhelmed!!! Its incredible!!!! If you can only afford one Broadway play you should go to Lion King. The effects are incredible! You can go alone, with friends and family and children! It fun for every age!! :)	14	5	The most incredible play I've ever seen	Ana M
198	December 24, 2011	This classic did not disappoint Excellent  Great costumes	127	5	World class	RSTT3959
108	December 25, 2011	Even with more than 30 years of age i liked a lot the show. The actors are amazing, the dance and the music are perfect, what can i say .... a Disney show. A perfect way to finish a day in NY.	67	5	Really a Show	sylbanno
72	December 25, 2011	Whow! This Musical was very well done! The costumes, the actors, the singers, the scene changes were just incredible. My two favourite scenes were the opening scene and the stampede scene, very well thought through. This is a family experience not to be missed in New York!	57	5	Hakuna Matata!	Paula S
7	December 20, 2011	It was OK. Wish we chose a different show? So many venue's to choose and you can't see them all on one visit to New York City I guess?	7	3	Broadway Show	Jmalone1947
46	December 21, 2011	This was a brilliant musical, but I was hoping for a little more original stuff though. There were a few jokes about other Broadway shows thrown in, but otherwise it was almost exactly the movie played out on stage. Don't get me wrong the actors are wonderful,their voices are beautiful and the stage looked amazing, so well worth seeing. Tickets were about $200 each. Show went from 6:30pm til 9pm with one 15 min intermission.	56	4	Great production, not much originality though	AussieBizTraveller
5	December 22, 2011	loved it! Wonderful for our first show in NYC. My girlfriend has two young children and knew every character. We both thought it was beautiful and the opening scene... made me tear up.... so beautiful!	1	4	lion king	Angela B
57	December 22, 2011	Do not miss this production. Excellent venue and wonderful set and costumes.	25	5	Loved it!!!!	str8nm
44	December 17, 2011	I don't visit the theatre that often but if your going to see a show wheres the best place to see it; of course Broadway.  A great evenings entertainment, very colourful and some great songs	18	5	Don't miss it	philip l
34	December 17, 2011	They earned a standing ovation from the audience. The costumes are wonderful. Acting is very good. Singing was even better. Very well done.	13	5	Lion King is an Excellent Show!	Pat D
35	December 18, 2011	Addams Family was fun; Wicked a delight, but Lion King tops them all. This play is energetic and positive and can be enjoyed by all ages - DON'T miss it!!!	42	5	Greatest musical of all!	jewelsaj
13	December 19, 2011	The Lion King is worth the money, we had a thoroughly enjoyable evening.	3	5	Loved it	Richard W
17	December 12, 2011	Saw it from the upper circle and love it. My kids loved it too, although my wife thinks the one we saw in 2002 in London was better	7	5	Great for kids	caiusdalmau
29	December 13, 2011	Went with another couple and their 14 year old and us and our almost 5 year old. Everyine loved it (including our friends from Italy who mostly don;t know Enlgish but they know the Lion King story and music). Beautiful costumes and last row in Orchestra was great seats. Paid $875 for 6 tickets 9including ticket master fees) but as it turned out could have bought tickets that day at the box office, so save some money and try that. However, it was worth the price to see everyone (the kids especially) staring in amazement for several hours.	11	4	Worth the ridiculous price!	Bob14667
25	December 14, 2011	very unique concept. loved the new music! The theater was comfortable and you could see the stage from pretty much anywhere. We sat in mezzanine, but I think orchestra seats would be better - that way you can see the cool costumes head on	15	5	amazing show!	jj15951
23	December 14, 2011	The music, costumes and acting was amazing! Such a great show and well worth seeing.	6	5	Fabulous!	kellaussie

83	December 7, 2011	Loved everything about this show. The puppets were amazing as was the music.	74	5	Fabulous	wilmaBroughtyFerry
35	December 8, 2011	this show was first class, the seating was good. view was great. like most shows, not allowed to take any photographs.	16	5	amazing	rdrummondBoness
50	December 4, 2011	The show is very good, the costumes excellent, songs, singing, dance, etc., all excellent. My only observation about seeing this Disney classic is not to sit too far into the Mezzanine. I sat literally last row (Row L) and you do feel removed. In the Orchestra you'll feel part of the procession and are closer to the performers and grandeur. In the front part of the Mezzanine you feel closer, and are) much closer to the stage (which is usually teeming with props, song and dance).  In the rear Mezzanine you had to remind yourself that this was live and to not become detached. 	46	5	Classic greatness, BUT don't sit too far back in the Mezzanine	Ajjar
8	December 4, 2011	This is a must do broadway show. After seeing it once I when back two days laster to see it again. You have no idea how good it is until you actually go and do it. 	3	5	the best broadway show ever	David H
41	December 5, 2011	We had really bad seats, but loved the show. We took the kids and granddaughter for X-mas. Great time was had by all.	11	5	Family Fun	flying-olive
199	December 5, 2011	Great show for everyone, sit in the orchestra if you canafford it.	127	5	Roaring good show for all ages	nursely
4	November 30, 2011	I was at Lion King at Minskoff with my girlfriend two weeks ago. The stage work is just phenomenal, I've never seen such elaborate sets! The acting was also very cleverly done (I loved Zazu), and the musical score was very well executed, too. The theater could be a bit nicer (more bathrooms), but it doesn't distract from that magical Disney experience Lion King most definitely is.	4	5	Awesome experience - the best stage work I've ever seen	Lukas W
10	December 1, 2011	Booked this online, ticket collection was well organised. We all thoroughly enjoyed our evening although both daughters assured me the singing was much better in London's West End. Since I had not seen it before, I can't comment on this. Its quite true to the film and very cleverly presented. Well worth a visit.	37	4	True to the Film	fayattheranches
59	December 2, 2011	I loved it. There was nothing, I mean nothing to dislike about it.	39	5	OMG!!!! Take the kids! It was awesome!	Watchmitravel
22	December 3, 2011	I liked the production, the costumes, the performances of the dancers, singers, and loved to hear, some words in khosa language. Overall a great experience.	15	5	WONDERFUL PRODUCTION	Maria Eiras

12	November 28, 2011	I felt like an idiot, I cried during the opening scene. It caught me totally off guard, I wasn't expecting THAT! It was so awesome!	2	5	The Circle of Life	lemonysnickets
26	November 29, 2011	Went with our 2 gradchildren ages 5 and 7. They were enchanted from the moment the show began. A seemless production,the music was familiar and exciting live. The staging is unique,brilliant. The children were so thrilled. We had seats in the top mezzanine but still felt that we were in the center of things . Tickets are enormously expensive,155.00 each ,way back and up high.Too bad you have to spend over 600 dollars to bring 2 children to a show! Oh well, that's New York for you. If you can swing it your children will never forget it.	12	5	Fabulous Adventure	angie11111
119	November 25, 2011	From the opening scene to the final curtain we were enthralled by this play. The costumes and music are fantastic.  We were just amazed by the creativity and acting.	74	5	"A ""Got to See"""	chiefj
23	November 27, 2011	I have seen several Broadway Musicals but the Lion King takes the cake! The music and story is based right of the Disney movie, the Lion King, so most of the audience already knows it but the costumes and special effects are amazing! There are no actors in a Lion suit as one may imagine, but amazing masks and headpieces, as well as make-up and body movement make the actors into the animals of the kingdom. It is truly imaginative and innovative!	12	5	Best Musical of all times!	TravelBugNatty
43	November 27, 2011	A MUST go in NYC, Great if is your first time in Broadway. Lots of costumes. The performance is the whole movie, incorporating modern jokes. Great for kids!	12	5	Outstanding Performance!	gilhermm
7	November 27, 2011	Due to time constraints, I was not able to visit the place but had already pencilled to visit on my next trip. As said, to visit all places of interest in New York, it will take one a full year to and still come short with other places.	12	4	Movie man	Jos T
27	November 22, 2011	Saw this play for the 2nd time and cannot get enough. Besides being a wonderful production it has a very engaging theme.	10	5	Must see	charu s
5	November 23, 2011	When buying tickets, aisle seats on the floor have the animals walk right by you! Fun for the kids!	2	5	Great show	overpacker99
25	November 23, 2011	All the marketing, the Disney brand, the hype may be turnoffs when considering going to the show. I have to say that even with all those considerations the show is simply fantastic, the blend of the animated picture with the mechanics of theater, the African flavor given to it, the voices, everything is great. It is not a children's show, but the children will also love it (and stay quiet and attentive most of the time). Don't be snob about it and join the crowd going to see it, you will not regret it.	10	5	Fantastic! no way to be snob about it	riossb
54	November 24, 2011	great show well worth a visit, the costumes and sets are incredible	25	5	No worries here	AuldHoosePerth
138	November 18, 2011	I got the tickets when a friend had an emergency and couldn't go.  WOW. WOW. WOW!! The sights, the sounds, the score, the props, the puppets!! Been a theater-goer for 35 years, never seen anything like it!! The music is wonderful, and the cast an army of top shelf performers!	54	5	If you only ever see one show? This is the show!!	BEEBEE4545
82	November 19, 2011	Just went to the Lion King last night for the second time. It is such an outstanding show. I saw it in a different theater and both times sat in the orchestra. I think it is the best show to sit in the orchestra for because the animals come down the aisles and on to the stage. Save up and splurge! It is so worth it!	56	5	Amazing	Cr0wlondaPr0wl
78	November 19, 2011	The Lion King is one of my favorite Broadway musicals. The music is really good, and the stage and costumes are definitely worth seeing. All in all a must-visit when in NYC, I am sure kids would love it too since its a story about a kid who grew up to become king.	80	4	Wonderful show	Newyorking
31	November 20, 2011	Loved it! Such a fab show, if you love Lion King this is amazing and if you love theatre shows this is a must	14	5	great show!	njb81
123	November 15, 2011	Loved this show, anyone and everyone would love this show!	76	4	Exciting, Amazing, Excellent	Juanita_PEI
75	November 17, 2011	Our experience with the Lion King was a bit of a rollercoaster ride for us. We had just arrived from Australia and due to the difference in time we had put our travel information into an itinerary and it had our Lion King show on the Tuesday but it was actually on the Monday New York time. So we arrived for our 600 dollar fantastic seats only to realise we had screwed up the time difference. I was devastated and nearly broke down in tears. We were told that it was sold out so we could wait near the stairs hoping that someone didnt turn up. The floor manager was very nice to us and he told us that our chances were slim but he would do his best. Luckily for us he found us 3 seats and although they were not in as good a spot as our tickets we had paid for we were so grateful to be able to see the show. The show was amazing. Everything about it could be summed up as spectacular. The costumes, the acting, the props. It is a memory we will never forget and one of the highlights of our 3 year olds trip to New York. I recommend this show to anyone as a must see! Just make sure you get your times right!! 	58	5	Theatre at its best	justjess00
14	November 17, 2011	lovely production -- what's not to love?? The price perhaps, but it's great entertainment	43	5	classic	tervs
10	November 17, 2011	Took kids 5 and 8 to this show and we all loved it to pieces! It was our first show on broadway and one that will never be forgotten. The theatre was smaller than I imagined but that was a bonus, the lines for merchandise and drinks was long in the breaks but duck out just before or after and noone is there! Enjoy	7	5	Mind blowing!	minitrips76
8	November 9, 2011	This show was incredible - great fir kids and adults!	7	5	Phenomenal	Jwbjrb1974
17	November 11, 2011	We loved the show and being in the first row everything was awesome. Most of the people in the audience looked like they were going to the cinema and not at a Broadway show, no real atmosphere. The exits out of the theater are quite small, I don't think 1,500 people could get out of there safely in case of an emergency. :(	15	5	Great Performance - sloppy audience	MariaTheresaAustria
6	November 12, 2011	Great performance by multi-talanted people who can Sing, Dance and Act at the same time...  We got the 200 dollar tickets, which seated us in the 7th row in the middle of the hall, centered right at the stage. The performance was worth every penny, but if you dont want to pay that much, you can get the cheaper tickets. I got my tickets the SAME DAY from www.ticketmaster.com and i didnt have to stand in line in times square at the ticket box. You will pick up the tickets from the theater on the day of the performance. Sound quality was amazing... Singing was great.. Acting was very well done... The young actors are really good! No Cameras are allowed inside the hall, but after the performance, you will have a chance to get a picture with Mufasa (the dad). There is 1 intermission and the women's bathroom line was very long :) Overall, the performance was extraordinary and i would definitely do it again! TheZeee	6	5	Best performance i've ever been to!

30	November 14, 2011	Goose bumps from the start, such an amazing show would go back just to see it.	11	5	WOW	Jack B

94	January 2, 2012	This show was excellent. The dancing and the costumes were amazing. My teenage daughter and I loved it! We had side aisle orchestra seats which were good. Would definitely recommend.	36	5	Excellent Show	PAM857
199	January 4, 2012	All is there: humour, deco, dancing, singing, we enjoyed every minute of it.	104	5	Very good family show	Kuni07
111	January 5, 2012	One of the best shows in town for both children and adults. Visually stunning with timeless music. Excellent performances. As a grown-up, I was still awed by the special effects and the puppetry. Animals march down the aisle and make it an exciting experience for the kids. Great for kids age 3 and up. I'd go again.	51	5	A Must See for both Children and Adults	Raesa1
82	January 7, 2012	This was the second time We have seen this show and the first time was so much better.It has lost its sparkle	16	3	Not Great anymore	Gladys4412
100	January 9, 2012	The Lion King is one of the most fabulous productions we have ever seen. The costumes and the music is amazing. I highly recommend it. Kids and adults will love it just the same!	73	5	The Most Fabulous Production!	GraceinVirginia
22	January 12, 2012	Great for kids and adults! Great music and story. Great actors, loved the woman who played the little monkey.	12	5	Loved it	Amber D

2	January 20, 2012	you wont be disapointed this is a must see so realisic i would get tickets before you leave thou seems to be a sellout every night	2	5	fantasic	paul c
38	January 22, 2012	"I took my wife to see this show in November 2011. Even though it is a Disney production, It is not a ""kids show"" so to speak-- the songs, puppetry and costumes are appreciated by all ages. This was Taymor's best work and it remains one of the best shows on Broadway, even after all these years. The best seats are actually slightly further away from the stage so you can take all of the massive set pieces in."	46	5	See it before it's gone	laffingnetizen
33	January 25, 2012	If you want to see a broadway show while in NYC this should be the one.	22	5	Great !	Ryeback76
5	January 29, 2012	I saw The Lion King in November when I was in New York for Thanksgiving and I still have no words for how amazing it was. I'm already making plans to see it again with the same friends that I saw it with. It literally brought me to tears, both of joy and sadness (Mufasa's death). It was a magical show that is for all ages. 	88	5	I still have no words	wonderlusted-dreamer
7	February 1, 2012	AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The people in this play are amazing actors and singers. And very athletic!	1	5	A must see	HommerSpec
57	February 5, 2012	"My husband, 10 year old and I decided to go for Lion King. I'm not sure why but we did it. We got decent tickets and went for a Friday Show. I dunno, it was just not that big a deal. The story was thin even for Disney. The main plot was in the first act and then everything kind of went into time compression and collapsed too quickly in act 2. Almost like they were rusing to get to the big staging events. Yes, the costumes were lovely but that is not why I want to go to the theatre. I need a story. My son said it was ""okay"". I think he needed more as well. "	21	3	Not really a must do experience	TracyHawaii
27	February 8, 2012	I loved all of the animals, the play was visually beautiful but not the most entertaining if just going with adults. I love Disney movies, but I probably would not see this play again but definitely worth seeing once!	6	4	Amazing theatrics with great visuals.	rastoddard
14	February 9, 2012	I don't get to the theater all that often, but the Lion King definitely makes me want to go explore more Broadway and off Broadway shows. We sat at the orchestra level in the center (my boyfriend forgot his glasses at home, so we splurged for seats he would be able to see things from!). The cast and the show was amazing. I don't think I could ever get tired of going.	10	5	Best show I've seen in NY	KaityK
79	February 9, 2012	Except for the opening number which is terrific.... it was so blah. It would be great for Disney World... but it really lowers the bar for excellent theatre.	25	3	Except for the opening number..	Cole d
17	February 11, 2012	The show is nice, i would not wait month for tikets, For sure not the best on broadway 	10	4	Nice, not amazing...	orlyhareuveny
245	February 12, 2012	Years later, it's still my favorite show on broadway	165	5	Just wonderful!	GinaSamarotto

6	February 7, 2012	Went to Carmines and then the Lion King Show. Great presentation! Wonderful to see -costumes were great	155	5	Its one show you do not want to miss with your children	Mary S
41	February 1, 2012	It was a long, but the 2nd act moved along faster than the first. Fun watching the animals come down the theatre aisles.	20	4	Mesmerizing	travelwoman21
394	February 2, 2012	I love the music from the Lion King and was really looking forward to seeing this. I have to say I was disappointed. There was alot of use of puppets to depict the animals and that just didn't work for me. Given the choice between this show and some of the other ones out there--I would pass unless you get half price tickets.	153	4	Thought it would be better	712christineg
126	February 3, 2012	Colorful, inspirational and at times overwhelming.	85	5	Great theatre experience for all the family.	frequenttravellar
40	February 4, 2012	I was afraid that my 4 years old daughter will not pay attention for two hours, but she stayed on all the time and always very excited.	8	5	Unexpected...but wonderful	Mauro G
61	January 30, 2012	"We took our granddaughter to see ""The Lion King"" and she was just blown away by the whole experience. We've taken her to other shows but she says this was the ""most awesome"". Her grandparents and uncle truly enjoyed it too. The music and dancing were superb. We found the front row center mezzanine seats were among the best we've ever had. There was plenty of legroom for seating comfort (and ease in entering and exiting the row) and it was great to have an unobstructed view of the entire stage."	39	5	Wonderful!	bcoffman
24	January 30, 2012	Stayed in New York over Thanksgiving and attended The Lion King with wife, kids and mother in law. Great seats at a good price for a fantastic show.	15	5	STunning	Gallser

17	January 30, 2012	This show is amazing, spectacularly beautiful and moving	12	5	Still the best show on Broadway	cathydew
121	January 26, 2012	Every component of the show- from lighting to costumes to music to the sets was earthshatteringly unique and over the top. This is the Star Wars of Broadway- the show that raised the bar for everything that came after it. Must see in my book. 	69	5	Monumental and Exquisite	mtnchkbek
29	January 26, 2012	This was my second time seeing it. The first was in Dallas, Tx. It was so much better in Texas. I saw the one in New York in July 2011 and it did not have the same spark and ethusiasum. I felt like the adult Simba was too feminine and didn't fit the part. All in all it was a good but not great.	9	3	It's just okay	candilturner
183	January 28, 2012	Great theater and wonderful for family entertainment. Costumes excellent.	77	5	Fun, loved it	CTNan
142	January 28, 2012	From the beginning (if you have never been, I really do not want to give the beginning away!!), you will feel like you are part of the presentation. The mix of the familiar Disney songs and the authentic added African numbers will let you know why this show has lasted on Broadway for so long. Expensive, hard to get tickets and an experience that your family will appreciate forever. 	72	4	Enchanting!	mcprises
36	January 22, 2012	The characters and scenery were amazing. Truly enjoyable	14	4	Excellent. See the Lions	Cliff S

24	January 25, 2012	This was a first show I have ever been to and I don't think any other will live up to it! The costumes and sets were amazing and all the performers were phenomenal! We were singing the Lion King songs for the rest of the week! Not to be missed!	10	5	AMAZING!	megb05

32	January 21, 2012	We took our 2 sons, aged 9 & 11 to see Lion King at a Matinee Show !! We all loved it, the opening scene gives you goose bumps, it was spectacular. The tickets aren't cheap but it's a once in a lifetime opportunity to see this show & especially in New York !! 	27	5	Wonderful experience !!	holidayforever
5	January 18, 2012	2nd Broadway show I've seen. Everything is over the top! 1st show for my adult kids. They were amazed and Lion King was a trip down memory lane for them. Loved everything about it. It is in the heart of theater district so allow extra time to get there as traffic will back-up.	3	5	Excellent Show	beachtime44
81	January 18, 2012	Loved every minute of this show - Watched the Disney film again before we travelled and the cast managed to capture everything perfectly. Theatre was in good location right in the middle of Times Square - Bought drinks at the interval & didn't feel ripped off - All in all a great experience	42	5	Great Show	Donpipez
52	January 19, 2012	This show remains with you for a long time after you watch it. In fact, one month later and I still think of my favorite parts of the play. I look forward to seeing it again. It is suitable and enjoyable for everyone.	32	5	AMAZING	roadabug
13	January 19, 2012	The opening number literally brought me to tears. The set design and artistic vision for this piece is phenomenal, and the acting was superb. Adam Jacobs (Simba) has a voice of pure gold, and truly personified Simba. The ensemble was stunning, in dance, voice, and emotion. I hope to return soon.	9	5	Breathtaking...	city_hoppa
216	January 16, 2012	Saw this again for the 2nd time and it's still fantastic. It's a classic and a must see, but warning.....the tickets are not cheap. You don't need to get the most expensive seats in the house because the theater is small enough to get great viewing from 95% of the seats.	129	5	Excellent	WorldTravelSnob
33	January 16, 2012	Beautiful, artistic show. Much like the movie, but the set and costumes are breathtaking. Very entertaining. Get aisle seats if you can, as the cast goes up and down the stairs during certain songs.	15	5	In-cre-di-ble	ariane s
12	January 17, 2012	Show relied heavily on puppet-like augmentations onto people. Overall, show was quite enjoyable, funny and all around worthy!	17	4	Wonderful show!	Kayesh
6	January 17, 2012	fantastic, was the best show i have ever seen!!! if you get a chance to see a broadway show go and see the lion king 	5	5	best show ever	stephuk1982
25	January 15, 2012	Great show with incredible actors. It's clearly a Disney show because no detail is overlooked. Tickets are tough to get, but worth the wait. 	9	5	Excellent!	travelwithhubby
39	January 15, 2012	It's a show geared for kids, but adults will marvel at the puppetry	21	4	The (Lion) King of Broadway	ManofPan
40	January 15, 2012	an amazing production . well worth it .We got tix from the their box office but go to TKTS IN South Street Seaport as there rarely a line up there so your not wasting valuable NYC time 	28	5	fantastic	luvluvluvBali

18	January 13, 2012	loved it...have seen it in so many other countries and it still did not disappoint.	5	5	Brought a tear to my eye	MariaLadzBorbz
188	January 13, 2012	I was with kids but even for adults this play doesn't fails and it's a great play. But if you are not a fan of Disney movies you might also check other Broadway productions. The only bad thing is the terrible service they give you at the Soda/Snacks Bar.	268	5	Amazing.	Oscar A
125	January 14, 2012	Think the Lion King Movie - but in real 3D!!! Seriously - an elephant (real size!) walks down the aisle!!! It's truly spectacular for the eyes and the story and songs are ones we all know and love!! Not to be missed! I've seen it twice on Broadway and once in Montreal and would see it again if I could!!!	182	5	Classic Disney brought to life!	ddkphotos
1	January 9, 2012	...and majestic. It is a sheer and almost overwhelming spectacle of color. The sets and the dancing are spellbinding. Loved it! Magnificent.	17	4	Magnificent	Lourdes M

32	January 7, 2012	Lion King is just a wonderful feel good story with a great cast of dancers, singers. The sets are beautiful and the music just makes you want to laugh and cry...Go see it..PLEASE!	29	5	WIth or without children, its a must	Glorianne G
61	January 8, 2012	I was not excited about going but my husband wanted to see it. As it turned out, I loved it - very entertaining.	28	5	Great show!	pstein49
168	January 8, 2012	ONE OF THE BEST!! I could go over and over. It could make you PURRRR!! What a delightful story!!! So well done and inavative!! Brilliant!!!	91	5	ROAR!!!	HillaryNewYork
3	January 9, 2012	"The Lion King was phenomenal. The Disney Broadway experience is a lot different from the standard Broadway experience. You are allowed to bring in drinks and snacks, and they have some signature cocktails... I had Scar's Something and it was great - and I think it was only $10 including the souvenir cup. There were vendors wandering around selling stuffed animals during intermission, and all of the kids in the theater were so amazed by everything that they made the show more fun. The funniest thing was when Simba and Nala meet again and one little girl squealed, ""EWWW THEY KISSED!"" Her parents seemed mortified but the rest of us thought it was hilarious. We had center orchestra aisle seats, row N, courtesy of American Express... without spoiling anything, I highly recommend aisle seats for this show. The attached photo was taken inside the theater at a viewing area that overlooks Times Square."	2	5	Wonderful show	parfaits

220	January 5, 2012	Cant give you much info, since I did not enjoy this play at all. From the moment we sat down, the music, stage, and all the dynamics proved to be amateurish to say the least. Save your money and pick another, we left way before the middle mark	191	1	Hated it	Hrima
294	January 5, 2012	"My four year old grandson was visiting us for the week, and this is one thing he really wanted to do. We had seen ""The Lion King"" thirteen years ago, and to tell the truth, I think it was even better this time. We sat in the Orchestra, and my grandson had the aisle seat. The animals coming up the aisle didn't phase him at all, he was entranced. The Hyenas ran up the aisle, we asked if he was frightened, he just said, I know they are actors. The stage presentation is still breathtaking, and the story is still relevent. The actors may change, but the excellence of the production is not diminished. We saw it the first time from the mezzanine, and I am not sure which I liked better, they both have their advantages. I would recommend that if you haven't seen it, grab a child, preferably one you know, and go. It will renew your spirit."	146	5	The Lion King, it is still King!	gourmand47
2	January 2, 2012	We went to the show with my brother and kids and we enjoyed the show , it was amazing.	135	5	Amazing	armando h
78	January 2, 2012	If you are thinking about a show please make it this one! My husband and I had a fantastic time at this show. The theatre was easy to find in Times Square, we didn’t have to wait in line to get in and once inside they were super efficient. The theatre is beautiful and very comfortable. Our show was packed out but we were lucky enough to get aisle seats and all of the animals and some of the show came right past us. The show was completely and utterly true to the movie with each and every scene included. The acting was spectacular, the level of production on the set and efficiency of the entire evening was just superb. We cannot recommend this one highly enough.	109	5	Just stunning	TAmember13
12	January 2, 2012	The price of Broadway show is kinda steep! However the ambience in the theatre is not great to that extend. Expensive drinks and limited too. Could have done better.	6	4	No Regrets for Lion King	novatan
9	January 3, 2012	Great night out,the stage,lighting,costumes,singers everything was just wonderful. Would highly recommend the show,the view of Times Square at night from upstairs window was class.	8	5	great nightout	priscillaq
21	December 31, 2011	The ten of us: adults, teenagers, child, and a Senior Citizen all saw The Lion King while in NYC this past July and it was awesome! Due to our relatively large number, we purchased tickets on line in March. We wanted to watch the show together, however, we ended up in two groups. That was fine, as we were able better concentrate on the show. Prior to seeing the show, we heard from friends and family who have seen it, and they all were struck by it. We were not disappointed! The seating lay out, the music, colors, costumes, actors, voices, and everything in between was fabulous. We had one heck of a time, and at the end of the show, it left us wanting more. We will try to take in another show this summer.	13	5	The Lion King, ROOOOAAAR!!	ensan
39	January 1, 2012	"i wanted to see this show for years, and i got a buy one get one free deal. i couldn't have enjoyed it more. it's stunning. it's amazing. you actually forget that the ""animals"" are people dressed it. it's honestly the best show in nyc!"	9	5	OUTSTANDING	Alison W
240	January 1, 2012	My daughter wanted to watch Lion King during our stay in NYC. I was afraid this would take us back to her toddler years. I was wrong - the theater version is so creative and interesting. it is impressive how actors and actresses use their bodies to mimic the animal's movements. The familiar sound track has a few interesting additions. The theater is very comfortable too.	137	5	Very creative theatrical version of Lion King	MCNICE9
4	January 1, 2012	Very entertaining!!! Excellent customers. Wonderful play	104	5	Awesome	Vondared
245	February 13, 2012	I have seen this show five times over the years and I am in awe every single time and how incredible it continues to be!! The costumes are so innovative and the characters have such personality. Rafiki is the BEST!! This show is great for all ages and will make everyone jump out their seats to give a standing ovation!	253	5	Fifth time seeing it and it only gets better!!	SEGMN
8	February 17, 2012	Everyone should see the Lion King. Costumes were outstanding and music the best.	2	5	The best	Tripnevada
25	February 19, 2012	"I actually saw this in Sept 2003(wasn't an option in the date box) with my mom and bf and I was pleasantly surprised. Having seen the movie ""the Lion King"" as a child I didn't see how it would transfer very well into a show but they did a wonderful job. The costumes, make-up, and masks were very serious and at first maybe even seemed too serious but as the show continued I was so drawn in and everything went so well together. There was a moment that actually even gave me chills because it was so touching. I only hope it is still as well produced and acted as it was then so others can enojy it as much as I did."	2	5	One of the best Broadway shows I've seen!	Ana2101
15	February 20, 2012	The movie is one of my favorites and the Broadway performance was equally awesome! The scenery, music and costumes were amazing! Really a great show for all ages!	10	5	awesome experience!	jgirl1313
28	February 22, 2012	Loved the costumes and the singing. We had orchestra seats and they were really good seats. Didn't like that we couldn't even take pictures of the theatre before the beginning of the show.	11	5	Amazing!!	nidiadesign
30	February 24, 2012	if you want to see a play in ny then wait until there to but tickets from times square you will get them so cheap,the queues are long but go in fast,I bought 2 here before i left at a cost of £200.,my friends bought them in ny for £50.	23	2	love the theatre ,but not this one	lilpuddleduck
97	February 26, 2012	IMHO Lion King and beauty and the beast are the best movies and plays that ever happened to Broadway. Lion King is the most original play I have ever seen. My kids were mesmerized. The costumes, acting sets and opening act are breathtaking. Nothing compares to this show. I have seen little mermaid, tarzan, mary poppins and Lion King is still a major notch above. I only wish the Disney writers who wrote this wonderful story would be able to give us another gem!	80	5	Disney!! You finally got it right!	minijeanie
57	February 29, 2012	I thoroughly enjoyed The Lion King. It was a fun musical and incredibly beautiful. The set and costumes really made the whole experience quite magical. Watching the show on Broadway was a great way to re-live my favorite childhood Disney movie. Highly recommended!	67	4	A great way to re-live my favorite childhood Disney movie	IAH88
107	March 3, 2012	"When this show first opened the reviews were incredible and yet despite how much I love Broadway and dancing, I never ever got around to seeing the show. For some reason I just assumed that it was for children. Wrong. This show really changed the way that a show can be choreographed and today shows like War Horse, Avenue Q and others have learned so much from this show's pioneering use of space, dance, puppets and the overall visual experience. I had already seen War Horse and Avenue Q when I finally got around to seeing The Lion King so it was truly, for me at least, a revelation to see just how much choreography has evolved from this particular show. This show just changed everything. When it opened, no one had ever dared anything quite so unusual with so many dancers, so many puppets, so many beautiful special illusions. When you see something done that appears effortless it often is not. This show is extremely complex but simply beautiful. You never see just how hard a show it really is to perform because the actors make it look so easy. Despite having been around for a very long time, this is truly a show not to be missed! It really doesn't matter who the actors are when you see this particular show. Each and every one gives his or her all and it is not a show where you need a ""star"" to make the show something special. Here the show itself is the star and is truly something special."	67	5	Wonderful show with fabulous dancing and singing!	montauk1
10	March 6, 2012	Liked - show Disliked - kids with cola, popcorn and chocolat making noises - but hey, it was the lion king.	20	4	Good Show	274856Michael
68	March 8, 2012	Everything I heard about this show was right on! It was a great place to bring my goddaughter. She was so amazed, we all were!	10	5	Not disappointed...	Kimaf
23	March 12, 2012	For all the disneyfans this is the attraction that you can't loose in NYC Just fantastic, the show, the performer's and all in this great and spectacular show in the heart of broadway...this is an incredible experience for kids and the people of all age's	9	5	Great Show	juliuxagain
144	March 14, 2012	I've seen it 5 times and it still blows me away. I highly recommend it!	73	5	Amazing	mike100274
125	March 18, 2012	The opening of this play is one of the most outstanding things I have ever seen. I took my family during my daughters' spring break. We missed the traveling production and I am actually glad we did because there is no way the traveling production could be as good as this. The stage at the theatre permits things to occur in this production that could not take place in a traveling production. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about my experience. The theatre is very nice, and unlike most broadway theatres, there is leg room. All of the actors are true Broadway performers having not weaknesses. Finally, the costumes are outstanding.	50	5	The most spactacular thing I have seen.	JollyHenceforth
310	March 19, 2012	Took my goddaughter to see this show for her birthday. What a fantastic show. Great story(DISNEY!!), great costumes and wovderful music. In all, a very magical time. The kids were in awe, sat there form start to finish with smiles on their faces. 	131	5	BEst show I have seen in a long time!	7Lisal
7	March 22, 2012	The Lion King is the best show I have seen on Broadway! From the exciting opening to the fantastic closing. We were 'wowed' throughout the show. We even got our picture with 'Simba' after the show in the lobby. I recommend this to anyone!	15	5	Loved it!	SeaTravelTime
17	March 25, 2012	How the actors portray the animals is incredible. Thank you Julie Taymor for doing such an amazing job!	9	5	Still amazing each time I see it	ShesFromTexas
9	March 26, 2012	This was my first broadway show and I thoroughly enjoyed it.	7	5	Great Show	englanddh2
8	March 26, 2012	The story follows the movie to the T. Nothing different. The best part of this show is the opening 20 minutes and it's downhill from there. If you never saw the movie then its great. But if you did then save the 100 bucks and go see wicked!	10	4	If you saw the movie. You saw the play	Jontravel1
16	March 26, 2012	Seen this four times. still great. you have to see it to understand. Adults will love it as much as children... if not more	232	5	Over and Over	BrooklynBrother
69	March 27, 2012	This was a lovely show, I don't do musicals, but I ended up going. This is basically the movie but with real people. With that said DO NOT bring your small children here, this is NOT a movie theatre, your incessant chatter and prattle is just plain rude. This is live theatre, the actors are on stage working very hard on their craft, they don't, as well as the audience need to hear your child asking questions or whining or crying. Please be respectful. If not just don't go. The show was highly entertaining, there's an animal parade in the beginning of the show, where they take their animal puppets of sorts into the audience in the aisles, it's quite exciting to watch. But much like the movie you know where the story is going, but you'll be entertained in the meantime. If you didn't like the lion king movie then you probably don't want to go then. there are a lot of shows out there you can watch, don't feel limited!	36	4	do NOT bring your small kids here, this is LIVE theatre people!	etherealprey
15	March 23, 2012	Costumes were amazing, was expensive but worth the splurge!!	4	5	Loved it!!!	grigio1976
69	March 23, 2012	I'm used to shows at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, so I found it a little unsettling that everyone at the Minskoff was dressed in jeans and tee shirts, ate food in the theater (often loudly), drank sodas throughout the show, and randomly were allowed to come in and out of their seats. There was also a crew mishap where Simba was left hanging in the rafters for a bit. Our six-year-old still loved it though!	32	3	The Kennedy Center's version was actually better!	MaryEliseM
6	March 24, 2012	Wonderful experience and great show. As usual can not take drinks purchased in the lobby into the show. Caused our guests to drink all their purchases in the lobby prior to the show. They almost missed the beginning of the show.	11	5	Great Show	twoeyeswild
17	March 24, 2012	The show itself has something for everyone. Lion King delivers on every level. Music...brilliant, Costumes...beautiful, Talent...best on the planet.	1	5	Best family entertainment in NYC	Scott T
29	March 19, 2012	I just can't even come up with words to describe this show! Go see it!!!	14	5	Amazing!	NebraskaNellie
142	March 20, 2012	Not as great as wicked but still a great show. I would not see this again. 	136	3	Good but fell asleep half way through	Hayles_s
27	March 21, 2012	Great music, costumes and set design. Stopped me from falling asleep- first musical to acheive this dubious honor.	4	4	Our girlfriends made us go	FSGoldCoast
9	March 22, 2012	Great story, acting, and music. If you have kids, and you can only see one show while in NYC, you can't go wrong with the Lion King. There's a reason why it has been selling out most shows for so many years. If you want to go to this show, buy your tickets in advance. You will not be able to get discounted tickets at the TKTS kiosk. Also, tickets are expensive. If you are on a budget or have a large family, it's important to know that the cheapest seats are $89 each. You won't be able to get these less expensive seats if you don't buy in advance, and if any tickets are available, they will most likely be $125 or more (I had to pay $142 each for a family of five!). If you decide to go, it's a guaranteed good time.	2	5	Great for the whole family!	EastMemphisTraveler
8	March 18, 2012	we had alot of fun in nyc but this was one of the place we had really good time	1	5	great experience	Eva R
9	March 18, 2012	i would see it a million times over.. the costumes and the music were outstanding.. 	7	5	amazing	Mary R
62	March 18, 2012	If you like traditional Broadway musicals, then you will be disappointed by this show. Fairly mediocre, with the exception of a few excellent performances. However, the visual effects are stunning and very impressive. It is certainly different. For full price (discount tickets are not available), it is hard to say that it is worth it. 	56	4	Spectacular costumes, but mediocre singing and dancing	Narasee
11	March 18, 2012	It's truly spectacular. The colors and costumes are eye candy. My daughter loved the costumes the most. It's a classic one I would say if you're in the area - it's a must watch. And it isn't a very pricey show to attend.	1	4	Great spectacle!	Lammy O
111	March 14, 2012	I missed the Lion King when it came to Melbourne Australia but when I knew I was going to NYC I decided I must see it on Broadway. The show was amazingly colourful and entertaining. If you are in NYC you must go and see it	23	5	Fantastic experience	Susan D
32	March 15, 2012	The Lion King was fantastic! The costumes, dances and songs were excellent and very entertaining. If you are looking for a duplication of the movie this is not it. However, it you want to be entertained from start to finish this show will not dissapoint you! 	105	5	Great for kids and adults!	Flyinman
278	March 16, 2012	When was the last time you went to a Broadway show where the opening number received a standing ovation? The Lion Kings' staging and costumes raised the bar for all other Broadway shows. Many have tried but none have come close to the brilliance of Julie Taymor. 	131	5	King of Broadway	Cindy M
16	March 17, 2012	make sure you focus on only a few exhibits; the crowds and heat are stifling; the art unbeatable!	8	5	Overwhelming	H199
200	March 13, 2012	Incredible, mind-blowing, fantastic, phenomenal! The tickets are pretty pricey but wow! It was definitely worth it. A must see for all theater and lion kind lovers. 	50	5	UhhMaaaazinggg!!	LatifaS_23
21	March 13, 2012	Really enjoyable, costumes and effects were really good. I was slightly surprised to see a mixture of the more 'traditional' costumes and puppets mixed with more modern 'cartoony' puppets, I felt they were a bit at odds with each other - but it still 'worked'.	30	4	Worth Seeing	scogirl
356	March 13, 2012	We truly enjoyed the Lion King. The performers have truly amazing voices.	147	5	Great Show	Scook112301
32	March 14, 2012	Very talnted froup of entertainers. The puppeteering was amazing. Now I know what the fuss is about with this show.	4	5	Great Show	Jme55

24	March 7, 2012	I saw this twice and cried like a baby both times.  The opening scene and the music is amazing.  The puppet animals come to life.	7	5	I burst into tears!	nycbag
124	March 8, 2012	I'm not so found of musicals but the tickets were a birthday gift to my daughter and I must say that I was amazed! Such a performance, it was actually much more than a show, but I guess that's Broadway!	62	5	Impressed!	JennyJK
16	March 8, 2012	Would recommned to anyone of any age. The songs are fantstic & the theatre itself is very impressive. 	5	5	Brilliant Show!	Mike7313
19	March 4, 2012	One truly incredible experience.You can swear there are real animals on stage. 	12	5	GREAT FUN for EVERYONE	sbrenik
36	March 5, 2012	What a show!!!  If you think of going to Broadway with kids, Lion King is a must!  If you feel like you're still a kid: Lion King (or Wicked) is the way to go.	58	5	Amazing	ViajeroRTW
18	March 5, 2012	I highly recommend taking in this show if you have time while visiting New York. It's truly an experience for all ages and you never know who you'll see/meet. (I sat next to Bono during a weekend performance) Being to many broadway shows, Id have to say that this is one of the most memorable ones! (for the show, not for Bono) :)	12	5	SUCH A TREAT FOR ALL AGES!!	frequentEuro
62	March 5, 2012	It's beautiful, well done, the kids act very well... It's way better for children than adults for sure!	41	4	You need to check it out	elvillatoro
25	February 29, 2012	Nothing negative to say about this show! Loved the colors, the voices, the animation. Fantastic show! 	6	5	GREAT FOR KIDS AND ADULTS!	tina99bean

8	March 1, 2012	The costums were amazing, the music was great, and the cast was outstanding. Just a great experience. I want to take my grandkids as soon as possible. I know they will love it, too.	9	5	A wonderful show for young and old alike	John S

31	February 27, 2012	The Lion King is one of my all time favorite Disney characters. The story and the characters are inspiring and touch your heart regardless of your age. We have been wanting to see this show for a while, but as you may have found out as well, the tickets never go on sale. So when my parents in law visited us in 2010, we decided to finally put an end to our anticipation. It was a November weekend. The theatre is right by Times Square and has a perfect view of the block. The theatre is nice and audience as you would expect came from every age group. The show was beautifully done as you would expect of any Broadway show, but it didn't meet the Disney standard in my opinion. Don't take me wrong, the characters, the songs, the stage everything was very well done and coordinated. And in the beginning it did look larger than life, the characters (animated) on the stage, the background music etc. But then show ends very quickly leaving you unsatisfied and wanting for more. It covers the story, but still lacks the Disney magic. The experience just seemed incomplete. And I realized 2 months later what it lacked when when we visited Disney world in Orlando and got an opportunity to watch the 'Festival of the Lion King' (again - after many years). There is no additional fee. Now that show was a proper Disney production - LARGER than life as expected, colorful, energetic and very entertaining, kept you on your toes for the entire duration (30 mins). The animals (floats), the music, the vocals, the costumes, the singers, the dancers, the stage - everything was just superb. Absoutely stunning ! That is when we realized how over hyped the NY broadway show of 'The Lion King' and how expensive ! We paid over $600 dollars for 4 tickets, and we left thinking we didn't get our money's worth. Wheveras the spectacle at Disney's Animal Kingdom was priceless ! It was like the icing on the cake, made our day. We enjoyed it every much. We would recommend saving your precious dollars in NY and using it wisely in Disney world/Animal Kingdom as you will go there at least once ! There are other broadway shows that you will consider a better value and more entertaining. Hope you find this review useful.	77	3	A good show but over-rated and hyped, and hence fails to impress :(	Anuli
26	February 27, 2012	Loved every part of it.... It captures you and brings you into the story	15	5	A beautiful theatrical experience	wendeenyc
3	February 28, 2012	One of the most amazing shows ever, you get so lost in the magic the animals come to life.	1	5	A MAZ ING!	LisaDeeBee9
180	February 28, 2012	The beggining is amazing. Don't miss it. The woman who play the monkey roll is great.	122	5	Awesome Show	DKRJ18
13	February 24, 2012	We waited years to see this one and it was worth the wait. Costumes are unbelievable and so is the music. It was like an old friend after seeing the movies so often with children and seeing the short shows in Walt Disney World. Great for children as well as the adults.	4	5	Outstanding costumes	EllaMocera
476	February 25, 2012	Great show. Kids will love it too. Very popular show still so make sure you get advanced tickets.	99	4	Loved this show	Jaymaxx
12	February 25, 2012	The lion king is amazing. The costumes are incredable. I have seen it 5 times, it never gets old. The clasic story comes to life on the broadway stage! You should see it, it will make your day.  	11	5	I LOVE The Lion King!	DeDe R
12	February 26, 2012	I wasn't sure what all the hype was and the tickets were really expensive. I was worried that it would just be like the movie or worse than the movie. However, I was stunned by the singing performance and the set. It was a wonderful experience after all. 	9	5	Hesitantly went, happily and excitedly left.	TinaEinkauf
18	February 22, 2012	great show for the young to the old. the costumes and the performance will amaze you. 	36	5	fantasic costumes and what a show	gofrancogo
6	February 22, 2012	I've seen many Broadway Plays/Musicals, however nothing compares to this. The way they brought this animated movie to life was an out of body experience! Imagination that comes to reality! You must experience this.	1	5	Breath Taking! Fantasy that comes to life!	razorrus
14	February 23, 2012	The cast is very talented, the costumes are amazing, the set is stunning. My husband and I sat in the second row from the orchestra and we had plenty of room. We were constantly laughing and smiling during the performance. I would recommend this for anyone. 	5	5	Awe	amusingme
60	February 23, 2012	the costumes and the acting. Only niggle was that a group of OAPs came in late and were in the row in front it took ages for them to settle.	96	5	Fabulously colourful	Pollyanna89
41	February 20, 2012	"I've seen dozens and dozens of Broadway plays and I have to tell you that this is in a class by itself. I've seen it three times and am still not bored because there is so much to see depending on the location of your seats. We sat front row on my second visit and I was surprised that you couldn't really see the pageantry of colors that you see from further back in the theater. But it was cool to be so close that you can almost touch them. You also get a better sense of how amazingly talented the actors are at close range. Oh, and the other ""Best Play""? Wicked with Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenowith. Awesome."	13	5	One of the Two Best Plays Ever	StillSilly
118	February 21, 2012	great acting, songs, stage decor and music. Must see!	58	5	A fantastic experience for all age groups	Sven F

8	February 20, 2012	Had a brilliant time, paid for best seats. Double edged sword though as could see miming in parts, particularly the opening scene. Still, an experience x	9	5	Good but miming in parts?	Sarah F
60	February 20, 2012	Just amazing. The costumes, the actors. especially the Hyenas were brilliant. Kudos to all the people who had the vision to put this on stage. Not to be missed. 	28	5	Amazing!	Rasika_Raghavan
10	February 20, 2012	Brilliant production for all ages! Outstanding set and the costumes are exceptional. This show is so much fun and well done!	6	5	Must see	MamaMia177
53	February 20, 2012	We loved it. One of our all time favorite Bway shows. Definitely a family show, too. No vulgarity of any kind. We had a great time. 	18	5	Wonderful, Amazing, Fabulous!	goodegg5
4	February 18, 2012	Seeing The Lion King was an experience like no other. The intro was particularly amazing with all the different animals coming through the auditorium to Pride Rock. It was magical! The music was great, the acting was incredible. The standing ovation that the cast received at the end was well-deserved. 	32	5	A Broadway Masterpiece	Bridget G
218	February 18, 2012	My second time, this time with my family.  Great show, great soundtrack. 	93	5	Great production.	RRM1020
166	February 19, 2012	I came here with my husband for our 5th anniversary. It had always been a dream of his, and we sprang for nicer tickets (aisle seat, lower level) which were well worth it. When the production starts and the animals began coming down the aisles, we were up close and personal with the amazing costumes and singers as they made their way to the stage. I was brought to tears many times by the beauty of the actors, the costumes, the singing, EVERYTHING. An amazing show which hasn't lost its charm after years of being on Broadway. Tickets were steep for us, but something I have encouraged EVERY member of my family to spring for if possible. We are already dreaming of bringing our son to NYC when he is old enough to truly remember the sites, and The Lion King will be a priority (hopefully it will be around forever!). I cannot express how worth it this show is, and of the 10 or so shows I've seen, I would pay the bucks to see this one over and over again. Don't miss it!!!	155	5	I still get chills... amazing show!	teachergirl01
11	February 19, 2012	It was a wonderful show. The way they do the animals and the music was just great!! I recommend this to anybody visiting New York. Great for families or just you and a friend!! 	1	5	I LOVED LOVED LOVED it!!!	Cryscrys02
78	February 14, 2012	The music will touch your soul - the puppetry was so imaginative and fun - the singing and dancing was great!	33	5	Amazing music and puppetry	mom2four1966
47	February 14, 2012	I had a great time. The theater isn't that big so sitting on the Mezz level about 4 rows from the front (row D) was still fine. In fact I felt like I could see everything all at once which may not be the case if I'm sitting in front in the Orch level.  Anyway, the show was amazing. They have got some very good special effects which are very creative. I don't wanna describe too much in lieu of giving the goods away. But I believe anyone young or old will enjoy this show immensely.	43	5	Creative production	K N
10	February 16, 2012	"The entry of the cast was great. Created audience involvement. The rest of it failed in comparision to the movie; it lacked charm, the singing wasn't extraordinary for a Broadway show. While the costumes were good, Nala's seemed very ill-fitted and the actress playing the part seemed highly uncomfortable in it. Simba's voice was the only thing that made an impression. Otherwise the ""Lion King"" failed to arise above mediocrity."	15	3	Brilliant costumes... not much else razzle dazzle	TravelbugMM
188	February 16, 2012	What a thrill it was to see this show! Our 5 yr old daughter sat w/ mouth hung open for the ENTIRE show! She was thrilled, but her father and I were just as excited to see this show. The costumes are wonderful and it is something I suggest to any family with children!	94	5	BEAUTIFUL!	meamaam
11	March 27, 2012	Tickets can be hard to get and you might think they are expensive but once you go you will be delighted that you waited and think that the tickets were cheap!	9	5	It is over the top!	dudley10

7	April 14, 2012	excellent performance, close to our hotel, got the tickets quickly and sitting was orderly	6	5	kids loved it!	Veru16
151	April 18, 2012	Every good thing you have heard about this show is true. From that first note....to the finale. Amazing!!	50	5	Can't say much more...than....WOW!	beachlady3
17	April 23, 2012	"If you've not seen ""Lion King"" you are in for a real theatrical treat. From the entry of the animals (via the aisles) through the closing curtain ""Lion King"" is a feast for the eyes and ears. Not just a show for children - ""Lion King"" has kept adults entertained for many years and will continue to do so for many more."	19	5	Roar!	MNC1504
399	April 24, 2012	My husband and I went to see the show in the winter time. He had bought me tickets for Christmas. I desperately wanted to see the show, but I think there was too much hype around it that I was a bit disappointed.  It was a good show, but there's much better to see on broadway. The music was nice, the costumes were the best part, but overall it was a bit bland.	124	3	Good show, more for children	parker617
30	April 27, 2012	In India we say Singh is King, but here at Minskoff or Broadway the Lion King does enthrall all when he performs - and roar he does. The energy, enthusiasm and performance are captivating. One wishes it would go on for longer. Seats could be better though	3	4	The King has his way	Kulcha1990
8	May 1, 2012	"This is a show I was hesitant at first to get tickets for because I couldn't get them at a discount through TKTS, but the show was well worth it. If you are going to New York to see a musical, be sure to put this one on your list if you loved the movie. The staging and singing was amazing. It makes you feel like you are a part of the Lion King film.  I would suggest trying to get aisle seats, as some of the action takes place in the audience, particularly in the opening scene, ""The Circle of Life."" I always say a musical is better in Broadway. For this one, I have to stand by that, with the special staging that comes up through the floor. Not all theaters are capable of that."	3	5	Must see!	James J
12	May 5, 2012	It's essentially a puppet show. Great for kids. A tad dull for me.	10	3	Great for kids	Sue B
53	May 10, 2012	I saw this play with a group of high school choral students from Tennessee. This was the highlight of our trip! The animals are amazing, the costumes colorful, the music wonderful! A definite stop while in New York!	42	5	Over the top!	NiseKay
212	May 13, 2012	paid alot for tickets and it was worth every penny plus. The actors make you think they are the animals they portray	127	5	mets were out of it so	tctommy
173	May 14, 2012	Amazing! I would see it again and again. Loved every second of it from the beginning to the end!! Just amazing...	88	5	..	ericalemus
6	May 14, 2012	I loved this right from the opening. Just incredible. We had premium tickets on the aisle 11 rows from the front which was perfect - far enough away to have perspective but close enough to see everything, plus the animals parade down the aisles so well worth it!	4	5	Amazing!!	Doctormissus
37	May 15, 2012	Have seen this show 3 times, this time with my 7 year old. It was magical just seeing the expression on her face. Well worth the money. If possible, pick an aisle seat in the orchestra section. Better experience.	35	5	Awesome!	cancungirl1999
3	May 15, 2012	the costumes and music. Liked that the theatre was just off Time Square	10	5	Lion King	Sandra B
39	May 10, 2012	Wonderful music that drives home the msg of the beauty of African culture. Costumes fantastic. Loved the play.	23	5	Lion King reigns as most touching play	Marybeatles
2	May 11, 2012	It's expensive yes but worth every penny and more if you've seen the film you will love this. Staging is amazing the singing is amazing and acting is amazing....first thing to do when you arrive in New York is book tickets.	4	5	If you miss this you've missed out	andyandhayley68
11	May 12, 2012	the entire show was first class would recomend to any body well worth a visit	11	5	first class show	Alan d
164	May 12, 2012	I have seen this how about four times and it never gets old. It is a fantastic show. The costumes, songs, actors, the theater - everything is just wonderful. My sister and I have purchased tickets to take my nephew cause it is an experience no one should miss! If you are visiting NY definitely go see the Lion King.	60	5	Fantabulous...	Shacheb75
69	May 6, 2012	Loved this production from start to finish. Had 2 teenagers in our party and they felt the same. Very polished and professional. Highly recommend if you love Disney and love the storyline and even if you don't you will still love The Lion King.	32	5	Pro as	Dawn388
2	May 7, 2012	Great location, right on Times Square. The Minskoff Theatre had extremely helpful staff, was comfortable and the seats had generous leg room. The Lion King featured excellent set and costume design and was suitable for all ages. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.	23	5	Excellent	Hayley L
5	May 8, 2012	This show was absoloutely amazing. Everything about it was brilliant and definitely a highlight of our 4 day trip.  We ordered the tickets at home (UK) and had to have them sent via will call, so we just picked them up at the box office before the show, which is located in the theatre. The acting, costumes, music, singing, everything about the show was amazing... and I'm a 23 year old bloke. My girlfriend loved it too. We had orchestra isle seats which meant we were near the front and the characters came down the isles.  This show is a must see if you're going to New York. It's slightly more expensive than a lot of other shows but completely worth it.	2	5	BRILLIANT! A must see	Nathan O
24	May 9, 2012	paid over $500 for a ticket there were literally screaming kids running around before show, and at intermission without shoes and shirts on and no parents to be found. One child came up to the couple beside us who was sitting on the end, and sat down at their feet and was talking to them. The couple asked where his parents were and he didn't know. No usher came to the kids either...eventually the kid ran back down the isle to another row  during the beginning of the show, this rude family who was extremely fat came in 30 mins late....not only did they completely disrupt everybody in the aisle because they were at the furthest seat (near the wall), but once they sat down they decided to have an entire conversation really loudly. The rudest thing ever. We spent so much money to go to this. The show was good obviously and it should have been a great experience...I'm not sure how these types of people even afforded to sit down where we were but maybe they get cheap discount last minute tickets or something. Very disappointing that it wasn't managed better (the kids and the loud distracting people coming in late)	46	3	completely absurd audience	travel_l0ve11
70	May 2, 2012	Brilliant is the only word to describe this. Comfortable theatre and colourful and exuberant display which was enthralling. Definitley on the to do list when you visit new york city!	140	5	Fab night out!	Southamptonboy
50	May 2, 2012	This show is definitely a must see! We saw three shows on our trip to NY and this was our favorite! I could watch this over and over. The lights, colors, staging....everything is so breathtaking. The actors/singers are awesome. The whole performance is just magical. So amazing to see what they can do with the stage and props. Great for all ages and especially if you love the movie.	18	5	The best show ever!	NCFAM03
12	May 3, 2012	Of the dozens of plays I've seen, this one will always stand out. The puppetry, the music, the singing, the staging, the acting, the dancing are all wonderful. We bought the recording at the theater and my children, especially my son, now know the words to every song. 	4	5	A work of art!	Robin61
22	May 4, 2012	This was my second time seeing the Lion King in about ten years, and it was just as great and just as thrilling as the first time I saw it. I mainly went as a present for my girlfriend and found that I enjoyed the show just as much. tickets can be expensive but I believe that the whole experience is worth every penny, and it starts when you walk into the theater. The Huge lion mask you see going down the escalators was a great and afforded quick picture time. Loves the musical, loved the performance, and am looking to go back and see it again soon.	13	5	The second time around is always better...	EastcoastBK
65	April 28, 2012	This is an amazing show. A must see in New York. Recommended to any first timer!	40	5	Great show, amazing costumes and fantastic music!	JJMontreal2011

37	April 24, 2012	A must see for all ages, I loved it. However if you read the book as much as I did (every night to my son, the show is word for word, I knew everyone's line. But still loved it!	15	5	A show of everyone!	jpwa101
16	April 25, 2012	The Lion King on Broadway is an understated masterpiece. It doesn't try to wow viewers with tired Hollywood special effects that leave little or no space for imagination. It wows you alright, but mostly because it respects both adults' and kids' intelligence. It also allows viewers to add their own imagination to the spectacle, which makes for a unique, personal experience. Wonderfully crafted puppets and props that look deceptively like something a child could manufacture enhance the storyline and let you plunge right into it. And a hefty one it is, full of Shakesperean overtones. A young prince, a murdered king, an ambitious, callous uncle. Sounds familiar, doesn't it. Human and animal nature are skilfully blended before one's eyes. Fortunately, there's enough comic relief throughout not to let the story become too dark, and an appropriately happy ending. 	10	5	A Shakesperean tale for adults & kids	MacMONTE
58	April 25, 2012	Took my grandchildren thought it was very expensive but it was simply magnificent and worth the money.	37	4	Better than expected	ceci1950
75	April 25, 2012	If you are a Disney fan or not, one must count seeing the Lion King as part of their cultural education. I took a group of middle school students one year and from our balcony seats we had a tremendous experience. My students talked about it for years. My son and husband saw it for the first time this September for my son's 10th. birthday. I got them seats in the upper level to the right. They said the view was amazing because of the different aerial levels on which the play occurs. Don't expect the movie when you go. It is an experience all onto its self.	23	5	It never grows old	Type1Traveler
7	April 23, 2012	Most of our party thought the singing and costumes were fantastic	60	4	Only one of our party fell asleep!	Vicky W
75	April 23, 2012	I truly loved the Lion King. It was always one of my favorite disney movies growing up, but to see it's adaptation on Broadway is just incredible.  The actors do a fantastic job of becoming the animals, their stage presence is amazing. It's just a great show- go and see it, you won't be disappointed. 	46	5	amazing experience	ms_golightly19
29	April 23, 2012	Made a last minute decision to attend this show and now I know why it just surpassed Phantom as the highest grossing broadway production. Singing and dancing were fantastic but the costumes stand out as the main attraction. Excellent job. Quick Tip: we chose a slow(er) day to attend and rather than wait in the long lines at TKS and getting into less popular shows, we waited in the cancellation line at the theater box office. All tickets available from cancellation are priced the same, and at least in our case we had some of the best seats in the house!	20	5	Surprised	ManUtdTx
27	April 23, 2012	We heard the costumes and set was spectacular and we were not disappointed. We purchased tickets at theater the day of show. We bought premium seats and they were terrific. It is a must see show. 	18	5	Amazing!!!!	Luvnilfe
80	April 19, 2012	the story is as the movie showed, whats amazing is how the props represented/portrayed characters/animals, the individual performance was great. but for some reason something is lacking...	54	4	great for family (with kids)	gendot
12	April 21, 2012	"It was a wonderful experience. I am not a ""theatre guy"" but I found it an experience that I could have again."	6	5	whoa	gymSalemOregon
30	April 21, 2012	An amazing production! Costumes and stage design were amazing! My attention was held captive throughout this production! Highly recommend for kids of all ages. AND, as an added bonus, it's CLEAN.. no worries about foul language, adult themes, etc. What a breath of fresh air!	16	5	A Must-See	laryan0616
219	April 22, 2012	Breathtaking and moving, if you only go to broadway once, go see this. Beware though, the bathroom situation and children really not good. I know this is problematic in the venue's but this part caused me stress. The womens room line ridiculous, each and every tome!	144	4	Again, Again....Love this show	lifeisaj0urney
2	April 15, 2012	Had aisle set for my granddaughter - she was engrossed!	92	5	EXCELLENT!!!! Well worth the price!	Julia C
3	April 15, 2012	This was a fabulous show. This was one of my favorite Disney movies but the live show was incredible. The child actors singing and dancing was like nothing I have seen before.  A definate must see!!	255	5	The Lion King a must see	Lennonscrush
29	April 15, 2012	A fun experience for everyone. Great costumes and music. 	14	5	Favorite Play!	Abigail C
6	April 16, 2012	It makes the West End in London look pretty cheap! The production was very good and we did enjoy it, the costumes and some of the effects were amazing and they could all sing brilliantly, but the seats were only OK and the cost pretty extortionate!	32	4	Very good but very expensive	Vanessa F
170	April 12, 2012	What a great performance, my girls loved it. I had heard such mixed reviews and I was unsure if my children would like the show. I was wrong -- it was great! The music and dancing were top notch. I had seen Wicked twice in NY and thought Lion King was just as good. It is a great show for all ages, you don't need kids to see it.	53	5	My kids were on the edge of their seat!	Karen G
262	April 12, 2012	6th attendance In 4 different countries... Always fabulous, especially the opening... Love it... The best musical for all generations...	128	5	My 6th visit	My-Ooops
16	April 13, 2012	Amazing puppetry, acting, singing and visual effects! Must see for children of all ages!	4	5	Bucket List	Dyea T
48	April 13, 2012	If you are an adult who appreciates broadway shows and the pureness of individual talent, save your money and go see a traditional broadway show like Chicago or Memphis. The production and puppetry were wonderful but there was no one individual who's talent shined above any others. It reminded me of a show I'd see at Disney not broadway. To top it off while it mostly followed the movie version, (spoiler alert...) They included a scene/song where Uncle Scar was seeking to make Nala his mate...it probably went over the kids heads, but perverse if you ask me. With tickets at minimum $163 each, do youself a favor, go on line and you can find discounts for better shows to see. We found $60 tix for Chicago and enjoyed it much more.	18	3	Overhyped	momof4hg
44	April 10, 2012	"We tried to get last minute tickets for our last minute trip to New York for our preferred shows but no game! We were outside the Lion King and we thought: ""What the hell!"" We could have seen it in London for years at half the price. but hey...this is Broadway. We went and booked tickets for the next night. Great show....and on our way to the theatre who is on the sidewalk but Liza Minnelli! She was getting all the attention so we just walked on."	30	5	Great theatre/Great show	ragazzi
75	April 10, 2012	It was great! Just like watching the cartoon movie... which makes it remarkable, the way they managed to adapt it to a live stage, with amazing costumes, special effects and stunning performance and songs! Great for kids!	23	5	Amazing adaptation of the movie!	Alex C
6	April 11, 2012	I have now seen this show twice on Broadway and I'm sure the second time was even better than the first. i brought my 9 year old Daughter to see the show and she was sitting on the edge of her seat for the entire show. A must see whilst in NYC.	9	5	A must see whilst in NYC	Rachel F
23	April 11, 2012	"Our entire family loved this show. We have attended other shows at home in NC, but this was our first Broadway experience. Rafiki was hilarious. I especially enjoyed the singing voice of the adult Nala. The costumes, special effects (loved the scene with Simba and Mufasa in the stars), and pageantry were fabulous. Just a note to help future ticket buyers. I purchased my tickets online and the delivery method was pick up at the will-call office. I had never done this before and didn't know what to expect. I called Ticketmaster before I left and asked if I could just print the tickets at home. I was told I could but that I would forfeit a $10 per ticket merchandise voucher (a total of $40). I was not aware this was included in my ticket purchase. I knew that my two teenagers could easily spend that on souveniers, so I decided to go ahead and visit the will call office. The ticket attendant was not familiar with the format of my receipt and first told me that I had purchased tickets for a future date. After she gave me my tickets and ""dismissed"" me, I had to prompt her for the merchandise credits, otherwise I would not have received them. The t-shirts my daughters wanted were $30 each, so the vouchers certainly came in handy."	9	5	HIGHLIGHT of our trip to NYC	123teacher
5	April 8, 2012	The costumes and outfits were amazing! The singing was lifting, while the amount of comedy in the play was just right as well.	1	5	Great family show!	beschman

44	April 9, 2012	it's a must-see in NYC, good for children and adult!	21	5	Amazing	ronaldogiusti
8	April 9, 2012	The costumes were incredible! The designers created costumes that were very imaginative and appropriate to represent the various animals in Lion King. I saw it in 2001 and the sight of them still lingers in my memory.	4	5	costumes were the highlight of a very good show	thecrewscrew
6	April 5, 2012	Saw this show with my 4yr.old grandson, and family 2 1/2 yrs. ago...Adults thought it was wonderful, but definitely not good for younger children...My little guy is very sophisticated and well traveled, but he was not happy with the theme, loudness and overall show...He was frighteded, at times.....We didn't leave earlier, but I would not suggest you take your children to see it, unless they are older.....Mary Poppins, no problem, for younger ones...That was a fantastic musical, for kids of all ages! ..... ......	2	5	Colorful, high energy, Great Musical......	Bunnyrabbitnj
141	April 5, 2012	Why I ever waited so long to see this show, is beyond me! We were seated on the floor/orchestra near the back. Good views, especially of the opening parade of cast members which gave me an adrenaline rush, it was so different and uplifting, with tears of joy welling up in my eyes! Extremely creative show! Wonderful for ALL ages, young and old! Would see this amazing Disney show again. The theater is typical Disney Magic! 	64	5	Adrenaline Rush from the start!	rncarol13
100	April 6, 2012	Recycled Disney movie. See something original, will ya!	151	2	Just like the movie- only with puppets	SterlingGuy
102	April 7, 2012	Great with a younger child, but discounts are rare. 	17	4	A lot of Hype and $	schMinkel
5	April 3, 2012	Incredible set and actors/singers. This musical is a must see. Loved it!	4	5	Great for the family	Karen H
132	April 3, 2012	"Took 90 high school students on a NYC class trip and featured this play as one of the top attractions. We were far from disappointed. From the very first ""curtain up"", they had us. It was enthralling. The cast, costumes, sets, sound, lighting, special effects, props and especially the harmony were just the best. Standing ovation at the end and they certainly deserved it! Cudos, Minskoff Theatre! Bravo!!"	40	5	"""The King"" is king!"	William H
37	April 4, 2012	I was very skeptical before going there. As i'm 25 yrs old, i thought that kind of stuff would be too childish for me. But me girlfriend insisted to go once to a broadway how. From the beginning till the end, i must honestly admit and tell this was the most beautiful show i've seen in my life...It's like you're watching the real disney cartoon! Live music, chants, costumes and dances were fabulous. So good that 2 days later we came to watch it again after finding some tickets at last...	11	5	the best show ever	Cabron4ever
99	April 4, 2012	Had so much fun! The cast was awesome! Great family show of course. Nice and clean theater. 	13	5	Best Show in Town	Mary S
52	March 31, 2012	It was a great play for people of all ages and if you're familiar with the music, you will really enjoy it. The best part were the actors suited up in the animal costumes.	6	5	"See ""The Lion King"""	Cynthia W
6	March 31, 2012	We saw The Lion King for the first time and loved it! Our seats in the balcony (left side when looking at stage) were perfect, and it appears as though there isn't a bad seat in the entire Minskoff Theatre. Definitely a must-see for any NYC visitor! 	1	5	Loved It!	JmiThng72
2	April 1, 2012	I am not a big musical theatre fan, but my friends talked me into going. This show truly blew my mind! It's an experience that can't be missed... And, we could only get standing room only tickets - worth every second I was standing both in line and during the show.	70	5	Flipped my Wig!	Mary Ann C
31	April 1, 2012	This was our one extravagant purchase in New York City and it was money well spent. We dolled ourselves up for our big night on the town and headed to Times Square for a quick bite to eat. The theatre was in the perfect location and the show was FAN. TAS.TIC! (yes, I have to separate the letters to emphasise just how brilliant it was).  We had goosebumps from the opening number right to the end of the show (I had to dry my eyes before we left!) The costumes, booming music and incredible performances by the cast made The Lion King the best musical I've seen anywhere. It's expensive, yes, but you won't see a show like this anywhere else.	25	5	Well worth the money - an amazing Broadway show	Kat T
13	March 28, 2012	The Lion  king is a classic. children of all ages love the characters and the story. Wonderful staging and a wonderful story.	13	5	how do they do it?	whocares20

WHat else to tell you , it so rich in colours, the history, the music , everything transport you right in the savana and you also become a member of the lion family.you will be right in the middle as also characters of the musicals, are going down the stairs between the alleys or in the balcony. it was unbelievable 	13	5	the best Musical ever	frenchdevil
73	March 30, 2012	I mean, what can I say, it´s a Broadway Show! It´s always fun, great, astonishing. But I expected a bit more I think. In the end it´s a great show, but it didn´t really blow my mind, and paying 120 dollars for the show is quite expensive I guess.	35	4	Very nice!	rafaelandrezo
47	March 27, 2012	The circle of life put me to sleep. note that this theater has three balconies. Sit at the top and all you see is the tops of the headresses.	155	3	BORING!	BruceLafleur
79	March 27, 2012	I have seen this show twice and I would go and see it again. It's beautifully done and it's for 'kids' of all ages. Really unique production and highly entertaining.	35	5	Excellent Show	Kiki2010
22	March 27, 2012	We enjoyed The Lion King very much. The dancing was wonderful, costumes wonderful, storyline very good. I think the music wasn't as dynamic as I thought it would be, maybe not as loud as I thought it would be. The actors that portrayed the main characters were amazing though. Very talented. 	13	5	Worth seeing once.	Wonderville
6	March 27, 2012	We see everything, and this is a great spectacular, can be enjoyed by the whole family. Make sure to pick up the free booster seats if you have kids.	7	5	Great Family Theater	bobles7289

38	May 22, 2012	Absolutely fantastic performance, loved every minute of it. I would definitely see it again.  The theater's really easy to get to, just off Time Square. 	12	5	Great night out.	Rosie B
4	May 25, 2012	we had a group from 7-58 on our trip and all loved it. the people were very fluid with their movements as the animals. quite expensive tickets, but a once in a lifetime experience.	3	4	good for any age	Monique G
36	May 28, 2012	Show was fantastic. Hard to know where to look next. No wonder it has been showing for so many years.	13	5	Fantastic!!!	sunny079
318	May 29, 2012	It was a great performance with great costumes. I took my daughter. We have watched this a thousand times on video so I was quite familiar with the story line .Although enjoyable, I had seen it on my tv screen one too many times.	129	4	impressive	susant771
12	June 3, 2012	I saw the lion king on broadway on a 4 day trip to new york at the start of May, I must say it was one of the best things we did. The singing, acting, costumes, and set were all absolutley amazing!! I can't say enough about the show!! I would definitely recommend it to anyone and I would see it again!	9	5	Amazing!!	NicoleM109

28	June 9, 2012	One of the best musicals I've ever seen, because I was fascinated with the props!	28	5	Love the Lion King!	dhplanome
43	June 11, 2012	I'm so glad we finally saw The Lion King. I was afraid that, after all these years, the show might be running on automatic. We thoroughly enjoyed the show. The voices were strong and the costumes/staging/set are just as stunning as we'd heard. 	41	5	As much of a visual spectacle as you've heard	AnnCS
142	June 16, 2012	We took our kids to see Lion King again, after seeing it seven years ago when they were very young. My husband didn't want to go because he thought he would be bored, but he loved it too, all over again.  There were the usual groups of screamy kids but not that bad. I feel a bit sorry for the ushers because you are not allowed to take pictures in the theater, and they had a big job with all the selfish families shooting away -  but the show is fantastic. Go! And then go again!	169	5	Still great.	heavycat69
12	June 18, 2012	I am a Lion King fanatic. We had a great time. We sat in the mezzanine center front. It was spectacular. The actors are wonderful, and the costumes are out of this world.	4	4	Amazing costumes	readysetgo323
51	June 21, 2012	Lion King on Broadway was incredible! The actors were amazing, and their movements were so on key with the animals they were playing. The costumes were by far the best I've seen of any Broadway play. They were so unique and imaginative and captivating! The stampede scene was also done exceptionally well. It was an all-around amazing show, and I'd definitely go back again and I'd recommend it to anyone thinking about a Broadway show. It's a great spectacle that you're sure to enjoy!	30	5	Incredible Show!	RebeccaN538
93	June 26, 2012	I loved the Lion King. I held off on seeing it because I loved the movie & I wasn't sure how I would like the different approach they took to depict the animals. What a fool I was! I was in awe of the puppetry and the colors and textures they used. It is a must see play!	20	5	Must See	CosmoKitty79
112	June 29, 2012	ive seen this play several times but enjoyed it the most at the minskoff	45	5	so good	Gary P
16	July 2, 2012	The costumes were elaborate, the singing was lovely, and the acting was wonderful! If you are visiting NYC, this is a must do, it's fun for the whole family! 	4	5	Amazing!	Minichef1
7	July 4, 2012	Absolutely loved it! Even my husband who doesn't like musicals and had never seen the Lion King before really enjoyed it. Would definitely recommend it.	3	5	Excellent Show	Vanessa R
19	July 5, 2012	This play is totally amazing. It seemed very expensive but I must say it was worth every penny. The scenery, costumes, and special effects are unparalleled anywhere. It is for all ages.	11	5	Unbelievable	Rosy M
41	July 5, 2012	if you ever get the chance to see this play please do  it was wonderful  we loved it planning on seeing it again	21	5	a must see	Latinoheat31869
14	July 5, 2012	Fantastic, I saw this in Australia, but seeing it on Broadway was the best	5	4	Show on Broadway	TravelBug0809
42	July 6, 2012	I took my 7 yr old to this show and she was amazed. The costumes , choreography, songs, story, etc are the reason this show is still one of the most popular on broadway after all these years.  I highly recommend this show to anyone taking their kids. For adults, I would recommend SpiderMan but for kids, it does not get any better than this.	83	5	always amazing	usatraveler77
198	July 3, 2012	This was exactly what we were expecting: a great musical review who moves from the beginning to the end. We were thinking that it could be too young for us, as a couple in 50s, but don't be afraid because this is an excellent show for all. Actors, music, scenery, all were very famous. I would be ready to pay again to see this show. Highly recommended. We were seated a little bit far from the stage but do not worry there is no bad seat in this theater.	150	5	What a show!	Paul-Claude33
9	July 3, 2012	We bought tickets on the Wednesday from the theatre and went on the Thursday night. We obtained single tickets which meant we couldnt sit together but they were a lot cheaper. I even got to sit in the front row.	1	5	great show	kacey617
41	July 3, 2012	This is the best stage show I have ever seen! The costumes, the sets, the music, the way the story was adapted from the movie and book and brought to live on the stage was incredible. The Opening scene across the stage and throughout the audience (yes, animals move around in the aisles so keep your hands and feet clear) was amazing!  This show is for anybody, whether your taking kids, your in the 50's or 60's - you'll love it! I'd suggest booking well in advance as I took the risk of arriving in New York and trying to get tickets (thankfully I did) but they weren't cheap! I'd definitely pay again to see this show! It's a smallish theatre so the closer your seats the better!	23	5	A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!	Jedi1984
55	July 4, 2012	loved the animal puppets, the costumes, songs, dance numbers - everything!	52	5	brilliant, such wonderful puppetry	margo c
320	June 30, 2012	"An incredible experience - there is no show like this that is great for the entire family.....even those who ""don't like musicals""....the special effects and costumes are amazing. This is a must-see for all live theater fans! Disney has outdone themselves with this one. "	98	5	Nothing like it!	lovenyc210
189	June 30, 2012	Sat in the very last row and still had a great view of the play. My wife and I and our 5 year old grandchild saw a matinee and the show was very, very good. We all had seen the movie, but that did not detract at all from the performance. Great choice for families	126	4	As good as advertised	drwiz
42	July 1, 2012	An experience of a lifetime. A tribute to music, dancing and colour. Without a doubt, one of the most memorable Broadway moments I have ever had!	51	5	Brilliant!!!	irsc
62	July 2, 2012	It is amazing how they bring to life the Lion King. It is important to shop the tickets in advance!	13	5	It is a must go!	RScalet
2	June 27, 2012	Amazing show! Costumes were outstanding. We took our 5 teenages kids and they absolutely loved it. 	5	5	Fabulous!!	bradybunchof7
2017	June 28, 2012	I am not a big fan of broadway shows. This show is fun and great for not only families!	379	4	Great Show	Autumn M
55	June 28, 2012	One of the best Broadway shows I've ever seen. My 22-year-old daughter and I LOVED it! 	44	5	Fabulous!	Virginia R
17	June 28, 2012	The costumes are very creative. The actors and singers were remarkable. I still believe Wicked is the greatest Broadway show out there though. 	12	4	We all enjoyed the costumes and the mechanics of the animals.	Dana A
67	June 21, 2012	Incredible. Enchanting and you will just want to watch again and again. I did not watch the movie and I think this was the best way to know the history.	18	5	I was hypnotized....	KRISFZ
32	June 21, 2012	Excellent costumes, excellent pupetry. No cheap tickets to this show - ever, so book your seats in advance if you waont to go.	23	5	Another Good Bradway Show	WDabs
58	June 25, 2012	Story line, memorable songs that make your heart beat fast! the puppetry is more then amazing a believable! So much singing talent and the colors they use to change to set and set the mood/occasion are perfect! Well worth the price!	33	5	Imagination at it's best!	vacationman1
5	June 26, 2012	I went with my mother and it was fantastic! I teared up after the opening scene. The kids were just adorable! And I loved the ever moving stage.	2	5	Great for grown-ups too	geblankensmith
38	June 18, 2012	High energy production, creative staging and enjoyable show for adults and children. 	23	4	Good show for the family.	MrBankz
44	June 18, 2012	I really enjoyed this! Music was great. Theater was very nice and clean.Staff was very nice.	14	4	Fabulous Costumes	atltammyb
7	June 20, 2012	Amazing show and actors! Must see in NY! Don't save money and buy a good (expensive) seats near stage - it's wonderful! Caution - it was rather cold in a hall!	19	5	Amazing Show!	DenisTmn
12	June 20, 2012	The Lion King was just fantastic! We saw this on Sunday afternoon of our visit. The theatre was full and we are sure that there was not a bad seat in the house. The seats that we had were on the last row in the balcony. There was plenty of leg room and the acoutics were excellent. We came feeling that we would be blown away by the special effects and we were not disappointed. Would advise you to see the movie first to fully appreciate how the stage performance develops the story line in such a fantastic manner. Our party included grandmother and parents of three grandchildren ranging in ages from 5 to 12. All were enthralled!	6	5	Simply amazing!	Nanny1999
5	June 16, 2012	Just brilliant - at some points I forgot that there were humans on stage (particularly the hyena's!). It seemed expensive at the time that we booked, but given how expensive New York is in general, we thought this was actually great value for money. What a show!!	5	5	It is well worth the cost - amazing!	rach12330
3	June 16, 2012	Great time at this show. Sat in the back of the theater and it looked so cool and interesting because the animals really did look real. The people kind of shrunk at that distance. 	1	5	January 2008	scharles1253
3	June 17, 2012	Safe for anyone to enjoy! A wonderful performance.	1	5	Spectacular	ExpressiveArtist
24	June 18, 2012	the music, the singing, the acting, everything was wonderful	6	5	amazing	Pili_12
44	June 12, 2012	In half a century of attending performances on Broadway, NOTHING has compared to The Lion King. An absolute MUST see!	13	5	BEST on Broadway EVER!	shh23228
415	June 13, 2012	It is a great play that you shouold definitely see (even if you don't have kids!). I have seen it multiple times and it never gets old!	487	5	Wonderful play!	Christine C
3	June 15, 2012	It is a beautiful show! Tickets are still expensive after all these years!	1	4	Wonderful show!	Debbie F
42	June 15, 2012	One of the funnest, magical Broadway shows I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. Kids will love it if they are familiar with the story of The Lion King.	36	4	Amazing Broadway Show	beckamoose
58	June 10, 2012	A fantastic experience I enjoyed it more than the movie, amazing talented performances.	31	5	Great Show	Spartacus81
201	June 11, 2012	I really liked this musical, but the tickets are way too expensive. I loved all of the songs from the movie, as well as the costumes and characters, but I didn't like the songs added to the show. I became somewhat bored... 	53	4	Very lively and fun	afelric1
21	June 11, 2012	brilliant show top class, went to see it after getting engaged in central park and dinner in the marriott marquis restaurant it was the icing on the cake :)	35	5	great show saw it nov 2008	lorrainequain
182	June 11, 2012	Not sure what to expect as we booked this as a last minute thing via Expedia. Seats turned out to be really good and bang in the middle of the theatre....stage, sound and effects were really worth seeing	121	5	Fab Show	Vic100Lichfield
151	June 5, 2012	it's a very good show for adults and children! Was surprised to see how actually small the Broadway theatres are. They sell advanced tix inside the theatre. 	57	4	very good	k0za
24	June 6, 2012	The most wonderful, amazing and magical musical I have ever seen - although the tickets were expensive this was probably the highlight of our weekend in New York. I would highly recommend this to children and adults alike. Fabulous! 	16	5	AMAZING	CharlotteJamie
46	June 7, 2012	I've seen this musical before with my husband, but this time we took my eleven-year-old grandson to see it. My husband and I loved seeing the show again, and my grandson was wowed by it as well. The costumes and setting are just magnificent! How the actors sing, dance, and maneuver the puppet costumes is just amazing to me. The music is moving, the actors terrific. I just can't say enough good things about it! Go see it now!	26	5	A great experience for the whole family!	Lynda442
52	June 9, 2012	The way the Lion King has been transformed for the stage is amazing. The set is quite basic really, but the costumes are out of this world. The portrayal of animals by actors is incredible. Young Simba is played by an 11 year old boy who is so good! Not cheap but worth the money.	26	4	An amazing show	Julz862
49	June 4, 2012	The Lion King might look that it is not for adults, but it is for everyone (since the history is inspired by Hamlet anyway). I highly suggest that interpretation of the story because it is very original. The way they present the story, the characters and the songs is unique!	27	5	Incredible	LePierre-Luc
14	June 4, 2012	"When your 13 year-old boy gives your wife a hug at the end and says ""Thank you, that was so great"", your 10 year-old boy whispers in the first 5 minutes ""This is awesome"" and your 8-year-old can sit still from trying to see everything, you know you made the right choice to spend the money for the show."	8	5	Great Show for All	Rick T
9	June 4, 2012	This is a lovely Theatre in an easy to find location. The Lion King was fabulous:performances and music just fantastic!	1	5	Loved it!	genevieve s
111	June 5, 2012	Sit by an aisle if possible. Many of the animals and characters use the aisle to enter the stage.	52	5	Great seats	des12404
26	May 30, 2012	I have seen this in London and on Broadway and they are both brilliant. We had seats on the mezzanine, which gave you a fantastic view, but to really feel part of the show, try and get seats on the lower level.	4	5	A must see show	mrsyogi
25	May 31, 2012	Seen it twice and it was awesome both times. The costumes are so original and the singing an music was so awesome. I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting NYC. 	10	5	Seen it twice...	ParkingMeter
9	June 1, 2012	I love attending musicals and have been to quite a few over the years but Lion King is by far one of my favorites. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great night out and particularly to anyone who grew up watching Disney's Lion King. The songs are the same and the performance here is amazing. The actors are really good. It reminds me of when I was young watching the animated movie - good memories :)	4	5	Excellent!	amedeodamore
23	June 2, 2012	Can't say anything that hasn't already been said. It is simply wonderful.	22	5	Spectacular	KellyH025
66	May 28, 2012	i know everyone loves it. i could barely sit in my sit. so long. not really catchy music. give me cole porter anyday.	46	3	this was a bore	travelita
14	May 28, 2012	This was my first Broadway show, and it's simply remarkable. One of these moments you'll never forget.	4	5	Excellent!!!	Uchoa
77	May 28, 2012	You have to go see this. All ages have to see this show. Great 	22	5	Go see	Clipcox2

365	May 26, 2012	No show on Broadway tops this one. The scenery, singing, costumes, and acting are unforgettable and one to long remember.	110	5	unforgettable	grantham353
58	May 27, 2012	Fantastic costumes must see at least once! Wonderful play highly recommend	18	5	Great play a must see!	leslie82
20	May 22, 2012	We bought last minute tickets, seats were good, but didnt think it was anything special.	6	3	Ok	RobTesCesOli
42	May 23, 2012	The tickets were very expensive, but I loved every minute of the show. It was captivating.	18	5	High quality, high price!	SPL49
4	May 24, 2012	Creative, colorful and a true visual experience. Saw it twice and enjoyed it both times!	146	5	Great entertainment for children of all ages!	Linda T
36	May 24, 2012	Love this show... 5th time seeing it! Incredible music and staging; outstanding costumes.	8	5	Great Broadway Show	Linda R
155	May 20, 2012	The Lion King provided a great combination of story line and quality acting along with stunning costumes.	38	5	Fantastic Tale	Wesley B
32	May 21, 2012	I feel the love for this play..my 2nd show to ever see & it was WONDERFUL...it really is incredible. I totally recommend for everyone to see this, the costumes are AMAZING. There were people of all ages in the audience, however I don't think I would bring my child to see this unless they were 10 years old or up. A wonderful story line & just a great show all around.	17	5	Ohhh I feel the love...	malityson
46	May 21, 2012	I love this show. It's great for all ages and it's so colourful. Beautiful score and the Broadway cast were terrific.  The young kids who played Nala and Simba were so energetic and had lovely singing voices.  A must see if you want to leave the theatre smiling.	27	5	Long live The Lion King	Katrina F
9	May 21, 2012	Absolutely breath taking! Great show for both kids and adults! 	1	5	Amazing!	Holly F
10	May 17, 2012	We really enjoyed this story matching at 100% with the Disney story (was a + for me and a - from my wife). Amazing Scenography. 	5	5	Great experience	myzterieu
11	May 18, 2012	For those who liked the movie, this is a really cool rendering of the story and music. For those who like live theater, this is a spectacular opening number, followed by a really cool rendering of the movie. Other than Disney's marketing clout, I don't understand why this still attracts large crowds.	3	3	Not really Broadway	rothkids
59	May 19, 2012	This production was so amazing! The music, singers, costumes, makeup... everything was done to perfection! The audience was a mix of adults and families, and the kids were spellbound by the whole performance. A very easy location close to Time Square in a gorgeous theater. Lots of restaurants nearby whether you want a nice meal or McDonalds with the kids. If you can only see one show... this is the best especially for families.	17	5	Amazing show!	marysvillite
144	May 20, 2012	I saw this show twice, once in the fourth row and once from first row center mezenine. It was like seeing two different shows. The puppetry is brilliant. The music was great. The production was unbelievable! I wish I had small children so that I would have an excuse to see it again!	167	5	A brilliant show	PennyAmouyal
186	July 6, 2012	We have enjoyed the show for the third time in a row and it is as speculation, as it has been. Some new actors in the cast, but as good as it can be. The only drawback is the understaffed refreshment counters before the show, during intermission. These guys are raking in the money with sold out houses but ar not capable to cater to the audience for refreshments. The line ups are huge, the locations partly stupidly located right across a narrow passage to access doors to the auditorium. After standing in line for the entire intermission, we were not even close to being served. The show is so good, that it didn't matter to us, from a service point of view it is however a poor joke.	75	5	As spectacular as ever	Hongkon
51	July 8, 2012	Creative piece of stagecraft but hey it's a kids show....however good for your whole family.	10	4	Great Show But a Bit Overrated	Dean S
81	July 11, 2012	Best show to see, waited years to see it, and it was truly worth the wait !! Costumes were terrific, singing was fabulous and the accoustics were great! Could hear everything. A MUST when visiting NYC!! A MUST@!!@#	17	5	My Dream Come True	charger06Boston_MA
77	July 10, 2012	first broadway production - got great seats - a little stunned by $$$ worth the money because production values music and stageing are beyond anything I have ever seen. Exceeds Cirque in wow factor. 2 kids had a blast too. Audience was a little ridiculous had to be repeatedly told to not take pictures	21	5	great experience with or without kids	jposttx
121	July 14, 2012	Wept like a child all throughout the show. As I'm a die-hard fan of the Disney classic, it was so thrilling to see it finally on Broadway--a real childhood dream come true. The sets, the entrance of the animals at the start of the show, the costumes, the way the actors portrayed the animal characters--these all gave me goosebumps.  We had center seats in the Mezzanine area, somewhere near the back, but never did I feel shortchanged or anything. The theater is small enough for one to enjoy the view wherever you are. In fact, before we got those Mezzanine seats, we checked out online reviews on the seating arrangements. A lot of people in those reviews were saying that the views from the Mezzanine were pretty awesome because you could see the entire tableau in its grandness from that area. I snuck in a photo of the stage before the show started because I admittedly wanted a souvenir picture of the place. But it really surprised me to see that there were people taking photos (with flash!!) during the actual performance. They should have been escorted out the premises. I loved the souvenir shop and I wanted to buy everything in sight. Bought a Simba stuffed toy for $20 (not including tax), which was still pretty great.  Overall, the show was magnificent and unforgettable and a must-see for every Lion King fan. I was so, so happy to have watched it finally.	143	5	Magical! Everything you want in a musical	kickgalvanic
21	July 16, 2012	My husband and I and our two adult children loved the play!	14	5	Worth the money	Marcia K
75	July 20, 2012	Tickets a little expensive but well worth it. Added advantage that theatre was really close to our hotel.	42	5	Brilliant show	whisks
15	July 22, 2012	The first time either my wife or I had seen a Broadway show. My wife had seen the movie, I had not. My wife loved the costumes, singing, and dancing and said the story was well told. I was impressed by the singing and the costumes. It is extremely fascinating on so many levels. Expensive, but worth it for a splurge.... it's not like we make it to NYC that often.	10	5	Incredible	Scott_DallasTX
299	July 24, 2012	Fab show my only regret is booking it the day after we arrived from Scotland and still feeling a bit jet lagged !	202	4	Great Show	sweetcheeks72
64	July 27, 2012	This play was wonderful, the cast does such a great job of being the animals. The opening scene was my favorite. We sat in the center of the very last row and we had no problems seeing or hearing.	20	5	Wonderful	pwaters44
18	July 30, 2012	The play was just what i expected! It was professionally done and what a great experience for us! My 9 year old daughter loved it!!	5	5	Excellent play	JwaG_Va
14	August 2, 2012	Went to the panthom of the opera and fell sleep :S I recomend to get the best seats you can afford, mine were 125 dlls but it was totally worth it, money well invested, actors are amazing, music and everything, almost cried XD	3	5	AMAZING	nethbeth
121	August 10, 2012	this show which we saw in the amsterdam was just mind blowing- the iopening seen was fantastic and was the best money spent in the whole of new york	71	5	best show ever	AllanThomson
96	August 5, 2012	Great to check out. Tickets are expensive but you're only on broadway once! Entertaining, even for guys!	47	5	Expensive but worth it.	ADG1234
3	August 13, 2012	I was in the Center 3rd row Mezz...The seats were great. I will see this show again. There were lots of kids and they loved it. You would never guess there were kids in the audience. They were totally engaged in the show. The costumes were amazing, the actors were great the stage and lighting was amazing.	3	5	Awesome Show	Tyshawn
6	August 16, 2012	we had been to two musicals prior and my husband said the lion king was his last try. We both loved it! I cried at the opening!! So passionate and amazing how the preformers can mimic the animals so well! You have to see this show! amazing! only thing I could say neg is that some of the audience were not dressed for the theater. Jeans, sweatshirts. It was an evening show in New York so I expected a more dressy attire.	2	5	best show ever!	Katrina C
62	August 18, 2012	That's a great show! Everything is so perfect. Go, Watch and Enjoy!  The theater is very comfortable.	21	5	Simply great!	pascalfr
349	August 20, 2012	We have been trying to see The Lion King for years but still cannot get tickets when we go to the box office. This is such a popular play after all of these years that they sell out night after night. Way to go Lion King cast... you must be doing a great job!	161	4	Still trying to see The Lion King	Flying4
15	August 20, 2012	Loved the show so much that we came back to see it a number of times! The music is fantastic. By far my most favorite broadway show and I've seen many. We sat up front and in the back on separate occasions and I'd recommend further away because the characters seem more real	7	5	Came back to see more than once	Danielle G
44	August 21, 2012	We enjoyed the show! Costumes and actors were fabulous. Tickets were very expensive, no discounts are available.	8	5	The Lion King is tops on Broadway	mellcola
34	August 22, 2012	This is a great show for the entire family. The costumes, the acting, the storyline all blend into a wonderful must-see show.	10	5	The Lion Rules New York	Mary P
347	August 22, 2012	I attended with my wife and adult daughter. Everyone was enthralled with the sets and the way they presented the animals. This is a worthwhile adventure for the entire family. 	125	5	Great for all ages	DrDadrwp
6	August 18, 2012	Definitely worth seeing while in New York :-) I would suggest pre purchasing tickets if u plan on going over the busy periods.	32	5	amazing!	emjay83
12	August 19, 2012	 I didn't want to spend that kind of money..but I did. Got great seats for $200.00 and it was so worth it. Took my six year old granddaughter and my daughter. Seeing Their joy and laughter made it worth twice that much!	13	5	Spend the money	bocellibabe
130	August 20, 2012	It was such a fantastic show, from the beginning to the end. The music, choreography, actors, dancers, everything was wonderful. This is NOT just a show for the kids. Both of my children, ages 20 and 18 also enjoyed it as much as I did and as much as any child would. A definite 'go to' while in New York. Made the whole trip worthwhile.	33	5	Amazing Performance of the Lion King	Phyllis D
127	August 14, 2012	My kids and I loved the show! The theater got a bit chilly during the performance, so be sure to bring a sweater. The costumes were amazing and the performers were so talented. Definitely glad we saw the show. It's a budget breaker, but well worth the splurge.	52	5	Fabulous Set and Costumes	Mindi B
111	August 15, 2012	It is a truly great family entertainment. Try to get lower level aisle seats. As the animals march down the aisle in the beginning, the children really get a thrill of not only seeing them, but petting them also. Great music, good values.	28	5	Lion King	alwestport
2	August 15, 2012	Love the music and the vibrant atmosphere. Very colorful and innovative. I just wish they discounted the tickets.	23	5	My favourite Broadway show	Sid10001
22	August 16, 2012	Our second time of seeing this show - once in UK and now in New York. Still electric !!! The animals are so life like and the story line great.	9	5	Animal Magic	Thelma62
99	August 5, 2012	Our first Broadway show and what a production. Enjoyable for all ages. The venue is excellent, not a bad seat in the house. 	46	5	Spectacular	nongagkram
9	August 7, 2012	This show was outstanding. Costumes and talent of performers are first class and I would recommend this show to everyone young and old.	2	5	Lion King - Outstanding	Emma Jane J
18	August 5, 2012	WOW. i can't even describe how amazing this is. This is Broadway history. The Costumes were stunning!!! Great way to introduce people to Broadway. A wonderful family event. I will see it many times. Well done Disney!	9	5	"""It moves us all"""	eneg0403
64	August 8, 2012	While I have seen mesmerizing live creativity on stage before but Lion King was out of the world simply because of the talent and and spell bounding performance of the cast backed by a solid script and production. You cannot leave New York without watching Lion King on Broadway. 	38	5	Out of the world	mailtoritu205
10	August 10, 2012	Loved the show! The costumes and puppeteering was amazing. The boy actor who played Simba was my favorite!	1	5	Musical	Joni79
7	August 11, 2012	The show was amazing. Seen in London before but this was just as amazing. The only things i could niggle about were that the air con was on full blast and we were freezing. We were at the back where wheelchair users get to sit wo our seats were not the usual theatre seats, maybe a bit uncomfortable. They sold hoodies at the interval and we were soon cosy.	4	4	Excellent show but cold	Shona B
209	August 11, 2012	I have seen The Lion King three times now, twice in NYC at the Minskoff, and once in Dallas. It really is my all time favorite show...the music, the costumes, the puppets...it's all just fantastic. This is a show the whole family can really enjoy. I recommend The Lion King to anyone thinking of seeing a Broadway show. You won't regret it!	90	5	I LOVE THIS SHOW!	marinerjess
3	August 12, 2012	Very entertaining for audiences of all ages. Excellent performance of all the actors. Nice costumes. They really captured the audience attention from beginning to end.	2	5	Awesome!	eplv
4	August 2, 2012	Such a good show and a must-see for any tourist! You get reminded of all the classic Lion King songs you thought you had forgotten about. The only down side is there are A LOT of children at this show so it can be very distracting. Although the show is done very well, it takes you a minute to ignore the people behind the masks/puppets too.	5	4	It was good	ohno55
34	August 3, 2012	Just phenomenal. Not to be missed. Kids will love it too! I've seen it several times and would continue to see it again and again.	20	5	Best show you will see on Broadway	NJtravelerrrr
8	August 3, 2012	While this show was not that bad, I found it to be quite drawn out and rather boring. The costumes though were fantastic works of art and the dancers were great, although the story line itself could use a bit of spicing up.	3	3	Poor compare to other Broadway Shows	Ekb98
86	August 4, 2012	I laughed and I cried. It is so beautiful. The costumes, the music, the dancing and singing. Fantastic.	25	5	I've seen it twice over the years, and it was magical both times.	triciaburke
9	July 30, 2012	Excellent show - the one to see! We liked the costumes, the music and see the movie come to life on stage. 	5	5	Don't miss this!	SoccerFan00
30	July 31, 2012	The play was fabulous, we sat in THE last row, center....we had no problem seeing everything on the stage. Highly recommend! 	15	5	Awesome!	cindylou57
68	July 31, 2012	We are in our 50's and went with our 17 & 21 yr old daughters. We all LOVED it! It was spectacular. Beyond what I imagined. It is totally worth whatever price tickets you get (we got $119 tickets - full price - and were in the 14th row - it was great!!!)	20	5	WOW WOW WOW!!!	MargaretJune2010
34	July 31, 2012	I was with my sister and next time I went with my daughters. Fun, happy, entretaining, an a story everybody loves. Good for all ages.	10	5	i've seen it twice	adrioverthehill
91	July 27, 2012	Loved this play again. I love the New York theaters, very small and easy to see everything. I would recommend putting children on the aisle seat so they can see the animals coming down the aisle. 	23	5	Fabulous-even the second time!	Scarlet4Houston
4	July 28, 2012	Fantastic music, greate singers and fabulous costumes. A wonderful time for the hole family! I have always wanted to experience a performance on Broadway. If you have the same thoughts do not let this chance slip through your life!	1	5	Great experience.	Anne-Sissel
5	July 28, 2012	The sets, costumes and props puts The Lion KIng at a distinct category. The actors, music, lighting, etc. were likewise tops.	4	4	A Spectacular Production	Mia J
22	July 29, 2012	I have been to more shows than I care to count and this was the BEST. The direction, the use of technology, the stunning performers, the choreography, the costuming....the whole package was absolutely outstanding. I wasn't sure what would think as it wasn't my choice to go to it but was out-voted by my family. I am SO PLEASED that we went. The time went so fast and that is always a sign of a great show. LOVE LOVE LOVED it!!!	23	5	Best show ever!!	kiwigirlAucklandNZ
14	July 25, 2012	Watching the face of my 7 year old at the Lion King was an experience of a lifetime. It was obviously a fabulous show. However I was overjoyed with how well it kept the attention of the young and old. Don't miss taking your children and watching them experience it.	10	5	Enjoy watching your children experience the Lion King	Dawn G
4	July 26, 2012	THis was our first broadway show and we were very excited. Took two children and they were on the edge of their seats the whole time. The costumes were great. Sit on the edge of the seating to get up close to some of the characters when they come down the aisle. We Loved it!	3	5	Wonderful	Traveler1248
10	July 26, 2012	This is such an awakening experience! I loved it! I think this is one of those plays for everyone. The costumes are vibrant and the music is uplifting. It makes you really feel like part of it.	28	5	Everyone will love this!	Ash286
51	July 26, 2012	This is one of the most spectacular shows every made. If you have the opportunity to see it you are in for a real treat. I highly recommend it.	9	5	Must See!	ChefCoat
7	July 22, 2012	The set and scene changes were amazing -it was almost like watching a movie instead of on the stage!	5	5	Great Experience	FrizzedB
135	July 23, 2012	It was really the best show I ever saw! It brought up memories from the VCR's as a kid. Not cheap but worth every penny!	97	5	Really the best show ever!	SanderCools
29	July 23, 2012	it's my second broadway show and it is simply AWESOME. this one is good for non-English speakers, as they mostly sing some african songs. i'm also sure this show will be the most children-friendly one. if you saw the cartoon (who didn't?) you will not need the playbill at all, the story is well on surface. the only semi-negative comment would be the length of the show, i found it somewhat short! i would gladly enjoy it a little more (: the hyenas are the best costumes!	15	5	100% must see	semya
52	July 23, 2012	Really enjoyed the musical. Have been to Disney world many times, the songs are captivating even if you are no longer a child or have little children...	20	5	Loved it!	aristoninsurance
4	July 20, 2012	Worth getting good seats! Stay after to meet actors.	1	5	Worth getting good seats!	Michele_and_Sean
45	July 20, 2012	"This is truly a magical piece of theatre -- ""The Circle of Life"" will take your breath away. Seats at the Minskoff are MUCH more comfortable than the New Amsterdam, which is where it used to be."	24	5	Breathtaking	ChrisandCarlos
24	July 21, 2012	"It's the same stroyline as the movie.The acting was good, the hyenas were somewhat funny, I guess. Nothing beats the movie itself. The part where ""Simba is alive!"" by the monkey was rushed, and for the first time didn't give me goosebumps. Girlfriend says the monkey actor itself was awesome.  It was still a good show."	12	5	I give it a 4, girlfriend gives it a 5.	Jeff C
31	July 21, 2012	Loved this show! A must-do for visitors to NYC....take the kids, the whole family will love it! Be sure to stop by Junior's, which is next door, and have the strawberry shortcake....to. die. for.	13	5	Awesome!	LynnW2
9	July 18, 2012	third time viewing !!...The Lion King. never been disappointed yet, good for young and older.	2	5	fantastic	muricia1951
2	July 19, 2012	Best show ever. If the theater wasn;t so pricy, I'd go every week!	42	5	I loved the movie as a kid..	Kate L
71	July 19, 2012	"This show is a must watch for EVERYONE. Don't expect this to be like Disneyland Lion King. It's BIGGER. It's LOUDER. It's BETTER! The casts, sets, music, and costumes are simply breathtaking.  I literally teared when the huge props and casts appeared from the entrance singing ""Circle of Life"". I watched this Broadway show again in Singapore the a year after my visit to Minskoff. It's not anywhere near the grandeur this theater house the sensational musical, Lion King!  Stalls seat better than balcony because it's pretty eye level. Make sure you buy the tickets before your show date due to high popularity especially in peak season!"	40	5	Simply breathtaking	sheisadel
26	July 19, 2012	Worth every penny, need I say more.Great for the family.Kids will definitely love this.	15	5	Watch it!	RedCharrlize
12	July 15, 2012	Loved the movie as a kid and loved the musical. There are no bad seats in the theater either.	2	5	Great show to bring your children	Scott H
271	July 15, 2012	I've seen The Lion King 3 times. The last time a few months ago and it was still fabulous. I have a friend who has never been to a broadyway play and she wanted to see Lion King. I know that people may think Disney, and think it may be corney, but it makes a huge statement that we all need to remember. From the music to the acting and all things in between, this is a great play!	112	5	It just gets better and better	arithecat
53	July 15, 2012	I had high expectations of this show since it is one of the most popular on Broadway right now. The tickets were unnecessarily expensive, but hey, it's Broadway! I though the introduction was the highlight of the show as it pretty much fizzled out as the story progressed. Unfortunately, the Elton John tunes were the best to hear as the rest of the score seemed forced and not fitting to the motif. I reiterate that this would probably be the best show to bring a kid to, but as an adult, I found myself falling asleep due to the lack of engaging music and vocalists. The sets and visual aspects were amazing though! 	22	3	Quality show, but obviously geared toward children.	MD L
12	July 16, 2012	Pretty expensive but worth every penny! The costumes and the stage - unbelievable.	2	5	Fantastic	anjab66
5	July 11, 2012	This is a must see. Went with my boyfriend. Costumes, makeup, music, and dancing was amazing. We are still talking about the show daying later. Will be back to see it again.	73	5	Phanominal show	1HappyTraveler2
9	July 12, 2012	Wonderful music and costumes .A real wow moment when the animals come in at the beginning of the show.	1	5	Excellent	Nicola R
38	July 12, 2012	This is artistry at its best! It appeals to adults and is beautifully staged. As a frequent theatergoer, I recommend The Lion King for the most sophisticated .	2	4	Not Just for Children!	Linda C
5	July 13, 2012	This was our first broadway show and we enjoyed it. We thought it would have been better than it was. I'd rate it as very good, not excellent.	2	4	Enjoyed it.	Ginger M
4	July 10, 2012	We like the lion king great performance,nice story, we watch the movie long ago, and it was the yes play specially for the kids, our kids loved it.	21	5	fantastic!	Marie B
35	July 10, 2012	If you or your kids liked this movie then you will LOVE watching it in the theatre! 	9	4	Better then the movie	Virginia M
30	July 11, 2012	My 9 year old granddaughter was mezmerized by The Lion King! We were all enthralled. Well worth it!	7	5	What a wonderful musical!	Sandra P
139	July 11, 2012	The Lion King was awesome. The costumes were amazing...the animal recreations were great...we especially liked the giraffes. The entire performance was great and the theater is very nice. I was upset with the rudeness of many of theater goers. They kindly request no photographs or cell phone usage and it amazed me how many people did it anyway. Folks...turn your cell phones off for 2.5 hours...it's the best present you can give yourself!	41	5	Outstanding!	ClickerM
26	July 9, 2012	This is an expensive show, but worth the money! I would highly recommend it to anyone....kids, adults, anyone would LOVE it!	6	5	Brought tears to my eyes!	emprincipal
6	July 9, 2012	some of the music is also very good and some are heavily borrowed from other musicals (Jesus Christ Supersat for example,,,) But overall it is a very good show!	1	4	Great set design!!!	MichaelTM
14	July 9, 2012	Eventhough it has received many fantastic reviews, I couldn't imagine how they would bring animal characters to life. The show blew my mind with the high level of creativity, incredible voices, all the culture & colours. Besides the couple of sad parts, I sat in my seat smiling the whole time! I've only seen a few musicals (wizard of oz, Mary poppins, wicked, chorusline) but this was by far my absolute favourite!	8	5	Favourite musical ever!	letti11
19	July 9, 2012	Incredible show. Felt like a kid again. Watched the 8pm show. If I had extra money, I'd watch it again. 	11	5	Love the show!	hibell
574	July 7, 2012	"This long playing attraction did not disappoint. We took our 3 grandsons to see it and they all raved about it--the music, costumes, etc. Make sure you add Lion King to your ""bucket list."" You will not be disappointed."	179	5	Lion King--a must see while in NYC	Les F
29	July 7, 2012	This was a great show with awesome music and costumes. I didn't have a great recollection of the animated movie version but I believe it followed the same story line. The costumes were just amazing-the giraffes and gazelles- really looked like the animals they were representing. The sets and acting were also fabulous. A very good show for a family night on Broadway.	16	4	Great Family Show	Danielle C
9	July 8, 2012	"I´m not a great fan of musical, but I really enjoyes the ""Lion King"""	5	5	My fist NY trip	karingr
5	July 8, 2012	I really liked it. My son, whose 10, loved it. I would highly recommend it for children. The story line was a little dark but the costumes were lifelike. You should take this in!	1	4	Enjoyable	Karen B
33	August 23, 2012	The Lion King was a great way to introduce my son to the theatre. It seemed like everyone attending came with a small child or children. The story is familiar to most children and it follows the movie closely making it easy to understand. The costumes and scenery were terrific and very creative and the performers danced and sang beautifully. 	17	4	My Son's 1st Broadway Show	Shanaof
14	August 28, 2012	"This was a terrific broadway production in a nice good-sized theatre (by broadway standards). The play very closely tracks the ""Lion King"" Disney movie, so younger kids who watched the movie would recognize the lines and plot developments and be able to follow along. Be prepared to spend some money, though, unless you can luck out and get some of the cheap seats offered on the day of the show (which is hit or miss). "	9	4	Wonderful production, though pricey	OlyBethM
6	August 30, 2012	wow it was so amazing the music the costumes it was wonderful full of color i loved how they made it just like the movie 	122	5	amazing	Jada M
12	September 1, 2012	My wife and I saw The Lion King today for my birthday. We live in the New York suburbs and I have seen dozens of Broadway musicals over the course of many years. The Lion King may well be the best Broadway musical I have seen. The costumes are spectacular, the cast, music, staging, choreography and book great. We had tickets for the first row center orchestra, which oddly is Row B. The auditorium was packed. There were a lot of small children who were well behaved. After seeing the show in person I can appreciate why it is still a sellout after 15 years.	3	5	The best Broadway musical I have seen	SubroSteve
76	September 3, 2012	"This show definitely brings back all your childhood memories of watching this cartoon. Its very well done, The performers seem to enjoy themselves and the music is great! One of the staff in the theatre was a little too aggressive with enforcing the ""rules"", and heard several people grumbling about him, but other then that, this show is a MUST see in NYC"	58	5	Must experience this performance.	ctraveller7
61	September 4, 2012	Lived up to and more than I expected! Costumes were brilliant; actors splendid and children super talented. 	32	5	The Best!	FrannywestcoastB_C_
2	September 6, 2012	Finally saw it the last time i was in NYC. It's a great show. Entertaining till the curtain goes down. The costumes are phenomenal. Even though it's a story I already new the signing and dancing just blew me away and kept me on the edge of my seat.	1	5	I was on the edge of my seat!	Irina M
122	September 9, 2012	Too monotonous... It is just for kids as it is a big lesson to life... Good setting and production though...	46	2	Just for kids	Paulo Mediano D
78	September 11, 2012	Amazing gowns. Animals really make you feel in the middle of the jungle. Loved the play, the songs are great and the performance all in all is outstanding!	40	5	Fake animals in the wild!	Portenita
31	September 13, 2012	Everything was top rate. Great seats, greatr acoustics. EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE. OUT OF THIS WORLD COSTUMES TOO. My daughter is friends with the costume designer's sister to boot.	16	5	CELEBRATION	Beryl H
13	September 16, 2012	The grandeur and creativity is mind boggling... the 2.5 hr musical extravaganza takes you to a different world altogether. The standing ovations over the last 15 years are truly well deserved. Watch it to believe it.	2	5	Unmatchable!	Abhinav K
23	September 18, 2012	a must for a new york visit. performance was amazing and worth the $130 each. really dramatic with the animals coming from the stalls at start.	8	5	fantastic	jgrierson
81	September 20, 2012	Ok, I waited on this one for a long time. It's expensive and there are a lot of shows to see. My mother wanted to do something special with the whole family (include grandchildren) for her 75th bday, so we got tickets to see Lion King. It's a fantastic production. The music, the costumes, sets, and dancing all combine to create a true Broadway spectacle. If you go, you won't be alone, but you won't be disappointed. Sometimes there is a reason a show runs forever and continues to draw a crowd.	32	5	It Really Is A Great Show	JackInBrooklyn
19	September 24, 2012	"My daughter's first time to see it. They have ""edited"" it a bit, shortened some songs (that needed to be shortened). Sadly, they took out ""The Morning Report"". It was missed, there seemed to be a gap in the story...."	5	4	Loved the Lion King!	Betsy H
74	September 26, 2012	Costumes were amazing. We really enjoyed the show as did the packed audience. My only gripe is that there was only 1 person serving (slowly) at the drink and snack kiosk so we didn't dare wait and miss the start of the show.	64	5	Lived up to the hype	NannyDawn
6	September 28, 2012	Great music, costumes. Prebooked so no waiting. Unable to take photos in theatre even before performance.	55	5	A wonderful experience	Dottieplym
28	October 1, 2012	The costumes were absolutely fabulous. We went as a group of 5 one in the group had seen this already 14 years ago. She was happy to see it a 2nd time because the show is done soo well.	21	5	Great show	Ginger C
45	October 2, 2012	Absolutely magical - an amazing adaptation of the film. The cast are superb - especially the puppeteers. Good deal on tickets from the Ticket Office in Times Square, well worth standing in the queue	10	5	Excellent Show	scrummyyummy
2	October 3, 2012	we were so exited to see the Lion King on Broadway..  our expectation were fulfilled so far is one of the best musicals for all ages. I sure recommend to all families.. enjoyable show.	18	5	best family musical!	RosannaTy
31	October 4, 2012	It's a great family show that children love, with a story that follows the movie and has big ensemble dance numbers. Entertaining for parents too.	12	4	A wonderful family show	mr100percent
58	October 6, 2012	One of my life dreams was to see a Broadway Show but what made seeing a Broadway show a truly amazing experience turns was the show we selected - the Lion King. We paid for the more expensive tickets towards the front of the theatre and it was worth every cent. The costumes, cast, sets were brilliant. My family loved it - highly recommended.	29	5	Only one word describes this production - amazing!	Kelly K
52	September 29, 2012	"Loved the visual feast and music. The adult ""simba"" was a little disappointing, had a weird accent and didn't fit into the story very well in my opinion."	43	4	Awesome visually!	smarty1809
7	September 29, 2012	This show is a fantastic experience and is a must to see. I am submitting this review to warn people who book tickets for the show at the Minskoff Theatre booking office. We bought tickets for the mezzanine level, which are not cheap , the row was ZZZ, on arrival at the theatre we were shown to our seats and we were shocked to find that rows YYY and ZZZ , were what can only be described as restaurant dining room chairs, placed behind the last row of the proper theatre seats. These became uncomfortable after about an hour, and we were very disappointed that a theatre such as the Minskoff has to resort to these tactics to earn more money from patrons , it can only be put down to pure greed and total disregard for patrons who frequent this established theatre.	3	5	Andy and Michelle Glasgow	andy f
48	September 30, 2012	I have seen this show both in London and NYC and it is fantastic. The price is a bit steep (I think I paid 35 GBP in London), but it was a memorable performance.  There were only two downsides that concerned the management/operations of the theater: 1. They let latecomers in even when the performance began (meaning people were still walking in front of the stage blocking our viewing). They should take advice from European theaters and close the doors when the performance begins. At $150 per ticket, I was not satisfied being interrupted 15 minutes into the performance to let others sit down.  2. They served wine in a plastic sippy cup. Now, I understand that the Lion King typically attracts children, but if you're going to buy a glass of wine before the show for $10, then I do believe it should be served in a wine glass, not a plastic cup with a red sippy lid. Again, this did not take away from the performance itself, but having gone to numerous performances around the world, this was certainly an awkward experience.  Overall, Lion King is a fantastic performance and the actors/performers are wonderful. I would certainly recommend seeing it. 	56	5	Fantastic!	journeys4thesoul
140	September 30, 2012	It is a spectacular show and great for kids - totally worth it and you don't need to buy the most expensive tickets as the spectacle is big enough to grab the entire theater. I would say that no matter where you sit, tickets are expensive so be prepared for that and it is probably not great to take your kids (we took 3) to the later shows as the show runs long, gets late, and it will take you a while to get out and cab/subway back to your hotel.	67	5	Totally worth it!	Mark J
81	September 26, 2012	The Lion King was wonderful. Outstanding cast, costumes, choreography, puppetry. The way the giraffes moved around was truly amazing. They actually looked real! Absolutely loved the show!!! The theatre was packed for a Thursday evening. I would highly recommend this show to young and old alike.	60	5	Loved the Lion King!	Joyce S
34	September 27, 2012	Perfect combination of African voices, costums and dance. A must see family outing. A 2.5 hours show you will never forget.	16	5	What a show!	Luc V
143	September 28, 2012	This is a great show stage production and costumes are amazing worth every penny , Would love to go again !!	132	5	Fabulous show	Haricat49
804	September 28, 2012	Saw once by ourselves in the middle of the orchestra and liked it more than from the mezzanine with one of the kids. There's a reason why it's still playing. Julie Taymor is fabulous	302	5	saw twice years ago	doug100worth
14	September 24, 2012	Came into the city for the day and everyone of us thought the performance was superb. Our ages ranged from 67 down to 4years and our attention was held from beginning to end. What a wonderful show and how true - so different from any other theatre performance 	23	5	Family day out. 3 generations enjoyed a fantastic afternoon at a packed theatre.	TimeoutLargs
121	September 24, 2012	An incredible combination of visual splendor and musical masterpiece. Get seats in the aisle to fully maximize the experience. Costumes were incredible.	49	5	Uh....WOW	Kaks827
12	September 25, 2012	The show and costumes were fantastic. Went to the early Saturday show and it was still a full house. Drinks and snacks at intermission are a bit pricey. Paid $32 for a glass of wine, a sm bottle of water and 2 bags of chips.	3	5	Worth the Wait	cmad242
87	September 26, 2012	Loved the Lion King! Costums, music, actors! Everything was spectacular!A lot of imagination went into the costume design.	37	5	The last roar for the Lion King	sunvalleygal
23	September 20, 2012	My wife is a huge fan of the Lion King movie and for years we talked about going to see the show on broadway. Her birthday this past year we finally went and it was worth every penny. The show is amazing from beginning to end. I have seen many Broadway shows and I would absolutely say this is one of the best.	4	5	Absolutely Amazing	James M
77	September 21, 2012	"We have never attended a real Broadway show before, but while in NYC we had to change that. We picked the Lion King, which was one of the most popular shows. The entire show and production was AMAZING !!!! The Minskoff Theater is very beautiful and a great venue.  Even though there probably isn't a bad seat in the house, we splurged and reserved seats right in the middle of the orchestra section row ""O""' center seats. The prices are not that much more than a good Las Vegas show. I would highly recommend this seeing this production. The young actor who played Simba was terrific. Such talent at a very young age. The rest of the cast too were extremely talented. You just can't describe all of the action and amazing costumes. Unbelievable !!!!"	66	5	Amazing Show & Production	MarkM36364
138	September 22, 2012	You know, I went with my daughter to see this show and was thinking it would bore me to death...wrong again vinegar breath, it is a great play for anyone and when you leave you feel you have had the total Broadway experience...go now and go again and again..	103	5	Lions Roar on Broadway	BFAW2
76	September 23, 2012	My husband really wanted to see this one, and he would rate it a 4. Because it is a family show, even at the 8 pm show and even in the most expensive seats there were two VERY young children directly behind us who talked (with their parents) throughout and kicked the backs of our seats. Asking them to stop and turning around to glare on occasion didn't do much good. The school-aged kids I saw there were behaving well. Luck of the draw. As far as the show itself, I enjoyed it, but felt like we saw a better quality of energy and talent at a different Disney show a couple of nights previous to this (Newsies).	25	3	Not as good as I hoped for	Pam D
6	September 18, 2012	I felt entertained from the first to the last song. The cast were all fantastic. The costumes were amazing. I couldn't fault it.	5	5	Great Entertainment	Juliet B
5	September 19, 2012	Great actors, casting, musical and theater. Got discounts because we bought the tickets one hour before the show was suppose to begin, which was extra great. 	3	5	Beautiful and huge theather	Marjori P
12	September 19, 2012	I love this musical! It might be pricy to go but it's worth every single penny! The costumes are genius, the actors are great...I wouldn't want to miss it for the world!	9	5	Just see it for yourself!	FabiJenneke
13	September 19, 2012	The whole spectacle was amazing! The costumes were beautiful, the music uplifting, the acting extremely professional! I couldn't stop smiling!	6	5	Felt like a child!!	europa1
8	September 17, 2012	it is an excellent show with gorgeous costumes and great music. BUT there are no discounts so you will be paying an arm and a leg.	1	5	The Lion King	mara g
48	September 17, 2012	The Lion King was one of my favorite movies as a younger kid, and seeing this play did not disappoint. My wife and I both loved the costumes and songs--even a few songs that we did not recognize. The actors were very good as well, with our favorites being young Simba, Scar, and Rafiki. Adult Simba's accent was strange, but it didn't impact the play. We would highly recommend going to see this play--especially for you guys out there that don't know the songs in any of the other plays!	26	5	Nostalgic Play Was Excellent	apathynext
3	September 17, 2012	Really great show, with beautiful costumes, wonderful voices and great acting. It was my first Broadway show ever and I loved it! I went with 3 other friends and they were equally enthousiastic. A must see when you have the chance! 	1	5	Wonderful performance! 	Lotteke
14	September 17, 2012	This musical is absolutely amazing and my nine year old son is still talking about how fantastic it was. The costumes and singing is brilliant. 	9	5	Must Do !!!	ArafuraGurl
25	September 14, 2012	I wasn't really interested in the story, I thought it would have been a childish experience, but I really have thank my wife for pushing me to go. I LOVED IT! Story is great, actors are great and the way they represent animals on stage is amazing. Really inspiring musical, I would go back again right now!	16	5	Great show!	Stefano L
109	September 14, 2012	"We took several nieces/nephews and my wife and I sat in awe of the majesty of the puppetry and the heartfelt emotions and songs as well as the message being offered all rang true for us. The kids had seen the movie a gajillian times were more mater of fact about it. ""It was good"" but they had a little ""been there, done that"" in their reaction. Every element of the show, signing, lighting, acting and stagecraft were all first rate."	53	4	More fun for the adults than for the kids.	PhotoTheatre
3	September 15, 2012	I have nothing but memories of watching the vhs version of lion king and this surpassed my own perception. Wow great job and awesome acting 	15	5	Old time memories	Viki B
20	September 15, 2012	This is a great show for any age. With beautiful costumes, stage design, and music, this show will make you fall in love with the Lion King all over again. This show is enticing and will pull you straight into the story from the very beginning.  If you get the chance to sit near the front you will get to see some of the actors up close during the show.	7	5	The Lion King For All Ages	Kathryn M
10	September 11, 2012	Phenomenal presentation and visual arrangement of the Lion King story. The actors and puppets were incredible and even as an adult, I loved the show! Not just for kids! Also, great cocktails too!	5	5	Best Broadway Show	LeoMoo
17	September 12, 2012	I was in total awe of the Lion King as soon as it started; when the animals came down through the audiance it blew me away! The animation was the best I have ever seen and the characters were spot on! LOVED IT ! Highly recommend seeing it!	2	5	Best Ever!	dietcokegirl4212
11	September 12, 2012	We saw twice. All was excellent, the actor, the music,costumes, acting, stage, staging, all wonderful, one being a child again.	6	5	Spectacular!!!	sarabea
41	September 13, 2012	Visually beatutiful. But pay attention to the music since the score is by Elton John, and is beautiful too.	41	5	Delightful visual experience	gerryb18
97	September 9, 2012	this is the reason braudway is the world renowned location. You will be singing the praises and songs for weeks to come.	65	5	not just for kids... amazing	StevenPhillipson
11	September 9, 2012	This show is brilliantly put together, from the cast members extraordinary singing talent, to the brilliant movement of the animal body parts, to the sound, to the costumes, to the props, nothing short of spectacular. It is a must see for all ages. 	5	5	Must see	Angela D
19	September 10, 2012	The sheer size of it, the imagination and the staging - the one musical one should go to if there is little time.	21	5	Exceptional	AmoshJerusalem
5	September 10, 2012	I am so glad I purchased a ticket to see the Lion King! I was on a tight budget and wanted to experience as many sites as I could so I was discouraged when I saw how much the tickets were. i went ahead and bought the ticket. It was the most amazing show. My baby will be 18 years old this month and watching the Lion King brought back so many memories of his childhood and the HOURS! watching that movie on VHS! I loved it. 	3	5	Texas Girl in the Big Apple	Kym S
32	September 7, 2012	Got to see Lion King at the Minskoff Theatre and it was great. The costumes the singing and the acting was very excellent. The opening of the show is spectacular so dont get there late and after that you cant turn away, even for a second. Our seats were front row in the mezzanine and they were excellent seats but it does not appear that there are bad seats everyone was very pleased.	19	5	Lion King excellent	PandJFlo
14	September 8, 2012	What a production! It's like being inside of the whole thing! Specially if you sit in one of the sits next the hall, that you should cause that brings a plus to the experience! :)	11	5	Beautiful!	ManuBol
74	September 8, 2012	 I loved the movie, but loved this play even mnore! It was so cool the way they did the stampede, the birds flying, the various animals waloking around. I sat in the balcony and had a great view of how these things were done, as well as a good view of all the musicians, which is something I liked as well. Just great!!!	22	5	FANTASTIC!!!	AlisonCorona_NY
60	September 9, 2012	Wow! What a production. My wife and I were apprehensive about seeing this show wondering how they would pull it off. We had read many great reviews about this show and when it was over we were not disappointed. Don't miss this one.	79	5	THE LION KING IS A SURE HIT!	tejas4us
85	September 4, 2012	The music and acts are great. Seating can get tricky, mid section is quite good. Stage has few features, best feature is animal representations made by humans	67	5	A great performance	lv_roadtrip_4evr
28	September 5, 2012	I was not sure I would enjoy the lion king however I was very pleasantly surprised.  The actors where outstanding, I had seen the film but seeing it in the theatre brought it to a different level. I would recommend this play to everyone. 	18	5	Brilliant night out	Bunessan
70	September 5, 2012	Let me start off by saying I am not a fan of musicals but I loved this show. The costumes were great, the whole feeling of being on the Serengeti with Mustafa was fabulous.	25	5	One of the Best Musicals	Alisa C
16	September 5, 2012	This was my family's (kids ages 11, 12 and 13) first visit to NYC. I really wanted for them to see a Broadway Show. I showed them the trailer for Lion King to try to get them excited. They were pleased to be going but I wouldn't say that excited. Well, this ended up being one of their most favorite things we did in NYC! They loved the show! The actors were amazing, the music moving and the costumes incredible! I was so happy their first NYC Broadway experience was such a memorable one! One tip: We sat about 10 rows from the front and on an aisle as we had read other reviews recommending not to sit right at the front, I'm so glad we listened! Our seats were to the right and row H. Awesome!	9	5	An Amazing Show for the Family	puzzler314
7	September 3, 2012	This show was as good as we expected. Fantastic music and performance - loved it totally. Very comfortable theatre and very handy to Times Square	1	5	Absolutely up to our expectations	Marion F
23	September 4, 2012	An amazing display of music, colors and pure fantasy. Not a show to be missed.  The only cons are the ticket prices: they are sky high. But surprisingly, all shows are sold out in spite of the price.  Make sure you don't penny pinch and get seats at the very edge of the theatre...it will spoil the experience for you.  I made the mistake of getting tickets through ticketsawork, where they don't let you choose your seats and guess what...I got one of the edge seats in the very front and it completely spoiled the experience for me.  But it remained a great musical. But for me, beauty and the beast was a bit better...although I did have great seats for that one. 	28	5	A spectacle not to be missed	Psychoanalyst
25	September 4, 2012	Would recommend to anyone especially with kids. My 7 and 4 year olds were just mesmerized through the whole performance. Amazing!	11	5	Excellent!	Ruth J
8	September 4, 2012	My daughter and I saw the Lion King at the Minskoff Theatre over Labor Day weekend. The production was phenomenal. All ages are sure to be entertained. The music keeps you humming and the characters are so talented. This is a not to be missed production.	4	5	Musical Production	Bentley29
88	September 2, 2012	From the moment the show opened, I was mesmerized by the music, singing and dancing. The actors transform into their characters with such ease and finesse that it is easy to become totally involved in the storyline. Everything about The Lion King is awe inspiring and thoroughly enjoyable. The performance I attended received three curtain calls. Not to be missed.	35	5	Awe Inspiring and Exhilirating	go_broome
60	September 2, 2012	What an amazing show, costumes, stage settings and cast were brilliant. The cast got a standing ovation. Good view from all seats as they are staggered and tiered.	26	5	Fantastic show	Satified10
34	September 2, 2012	Marvellous!! Awesome, spectecular and exciting show. Great actors, costume and all settings. Beautiful songs. If you still don't know which Broadway shows to choose, this is a great choice!!!	8	5	If you don't know which Broadway to choose, this is one great choice!	Amanda C
35	September 3, 2012	I live in Australia so coming to NYC was very exciting for me as a lot of my friends and family had been there and done that! When the Lion King came to Australia, I missed the show and I was very dissapointed as being a 90's kid my favorite movie was of course the Lion King! Seeing it on Broadway was spectacular! I could not wipe the smile off my face the entire time all I could do was sing along to the well known songs and think to myself I finally made it to see a broadway show! I did not want it to end!  For all of those who are umming and ahring about whether to see it....just do it! You will never see a disney show like it apart from Mary Poppins which I got to see in Sydney and it was also supercalifragalisticexpialidocious! Any seat in the house to the Lion King is a good seat. We sat in the Orchestra on the isle so the animals ran down beside us...this is where I turned back into a six year old and was clapping my hands and getting all excited! This was one of the best experiences of my life! I am so glad I got to see it!	22	5	Hakuna Matatta!	amylee91
289	August 31, 2012	"While in New york you have to catch a show in Broadway to complete your experience. My choice was to see the Lion King at the Minksoff theater. I don't don't think that as an amateur I can give a full review of the show, this has probably been reviewed extensively by other professional critics. But no matter how amateur you can be, you will definitely develop an opinion after seeing the show. We paid around USD 169 for the ticket and were seated in the mezzanine area over looking the stage, we had a wonderful view of the entire show. This is mainly due to the distribution of seats at the Minksoff, where no matter where you are seated you will surely get a panoramic view of the play.  The show is a two hour long aggregation of magical artistic representations. You are awed every single minute by the roles that those artists perform. Simba, scar, Pumba, Timon...I can really say that they are better than in the cartoon. The show is accompanied by state of the art soundtrack that keeps you immersed in the context of the show all along both hours.  There is not one single act that does not capture your breath away. I was really impressed and touched by the ""He lives in you"" act where Simba decides to go back to pride rock. The beauty of this act cannot even be captured by the video.  The Lion King is highly recommended while on visit to NYC "	408	5	Magic, beauty and wonder	SagaLEB
12	August 31, 2012	The ticket prices were expensive for a family (no rush seats available on this one during the time we were in NYC) but worth it to see the look on my kids' faces when the show started and the characters started coming out. My 15 year old became child like again in her wonder and excitement! This alone made it priceless!	36	5	Magical Night	TEPE
18	August 31, 2012	Two teenagers who also loved the performance. We bought the tickets at the theatre, sat in the orchestra section to the left, great seats for $119 each. The animals came down the aisle which was nice. Some people said it was cold in the theatre so we brought sweaters, but we did not find it cold.	32	5	Stunning	Sandi C
59	September 1, 2012	An excellent theatre experience! Don't miss it when in NYC. It has a terrific character imagination and performance from everyone is excellent, not to say less from the music and scenery. A must!	48	5	Extraordinary is the least to say!	Joaq
86	August 29, 2012	We've been to Lion King, because we tought that our 9 year old son would love. We all liked it, but our son almost slept in second half. Maybe because he is not so much fan of Lion king. The decoration, dances and costumes are lovely. I was expecting a bigger theater and bought more expensive tickets. Actually it is not so big. Back seats would be allright too.	57	4	Good but not perfect	ngok
69	August 30, 2012	My wife loved the entire production. The costumes were absolutely fantastic. When they actually sang songs, it was very good. Just too much yelling and jumping around for me.	27	4	Great Costumes	Macombvan
1457	August 30, 2012	The Lion King is one of those musicals that has a good musical score, fine singing, and good props but doesn't stay with me like Phantom of the Opera, Miss Saigon, or Les Miserables. I don't find myself humming the tunes in Lion King like I have done with the above-mentioned musicals. Could be largely personal taste. Having said this, this production is a fun, if inane spectacle that would particularly likely be enjoyed by a family with school-age children. I am sure the kids will like Simba! The play's location in the Minskoff Theater is right in the heart of the Theater District near Times Square and thus near good restaurants (including Restaurant Row) and hotels.	538	4	GOOD MUSIC AND PROPS, INANE STORY LINE BUT FUN	VAChuck
44	August 30, 2012	This is a fantastic show. I expected the performances to be superb, but it was the costumes, sets, and action that really blew me away!	15	5	Captivating and Creative!	DMynar
47	August 23, 2012	The staging, the costumes are the best a show has to offer. I go to Broadway shows often this is First Rate. It s rare that a show is for all ages this is the one. The songs you I'll sing for many years	25	5	Out of this world	Lewis T
17	August 26, 2012	I enjoyed Lion King so much I went to see it twice. The second time I sat in the first row and was thrilled when the animals made their grand entrance down the aisle to the stage and I could see up close how they were constructed. It was fascinating to see how the hyenas maniputed their customes. The music was fabulous. Definitely worth seeing up close and from afar for a different perspective.	17	5	Lion King Super!	Rhomeym
4	August 27, 2012	The Lion King on broadway is a must see while in NY! Excellent show!!! Wonderful for families and it really is one of the best broadway has to offer!	2	5	Amazing show!	missa685
60	August 28, 2012	I loved every minute of this show and hope I get the opportunity to see it again sometime. It was very stirring and was a highlight of our recent trip to New York. Loved the performers, totally engrossed and enjoying their work, the costumes were outstanding, music spine-tingling. The only downside was the seats being a little bit uncomfortable, but after the time the show has been on, the theatre was packed and the seats became unimportant. We had perfect mezzanine seats and could have reached out and touched the performers who started from this point at the beginning of the show and parallel with the musician in the orchestra box. Well worth the money and I would pay it again at the drop of a hat. Fantastic performance.	38	5	Spectacular	taumanu
21	October 6, 2012	I was so glad that we decided to attend a performance, it was amazing. We actually had ordered the cheaper tickets, balcony, but when we arrived I realized that there are no really bad seats. It was my first Broadway show in many years, but while people dress more casual, everyone was dressed nice. 	5	5	What fun!!	magicsmom
3	October 8, 2012	This was awful---REALLy Awful!!! Others have already made my comments for me. I only wish that I had checked here before purchasing tickets. Performances were 'phoned in' and uninspired. Story line was poor. I usually leave the theatre singing show songs for several days. My niece, who accompanied me, said it best when she shared that she was surprised that the cast could make Elton John's beautiful songs seem lame or worse. Do NOT waste your money!	4	1	I wanted my money back after 15 minutes	wendy s
160	October 10, 2012	The Lion King is by far the best live performance I have ever seen! If you're in New York, this is a MUST. 	80	5	Amazing!	USCTrojansFan23
44	October 13, 2012	Or, am I jaded? Has been running for so long...now, taking the latest generation to see it for their first time, the years of this show, show. Some third-rate casting & not as tight in performance, but the costumes and sets still can wow little ones.	13	3	A bit faded	E L
273	October 15, 2012	I love this show because it appeals to practically everybody in the world. It's all the songs kids love from the movie, its all the inspiring african dances that adults will love and how can you not love the story in itself? The creativity of these people is just unmatched by anything i've ever seen on broadway	130	5	Amazing show for everyone	amy d
13	October 19, 2012	Great show for young and old! I saw it four times and each time it is as good as the last! The theatre seating allows for a good view regardless of your row/seat number. ENJOY!	2	5	FABULOUS SHOW!	Dori N
22	October 23, 2012	"The Lion King was fantastic. I did not see this show prior because I thought mistakenly it would only appeal to kids. I was very wrong. The show is enjoyable for everyone. The costumes are outstanding and the show is just fun. The children in the play are amazing. The tickets were a little higher priced than I expected but it is Broadway so well worth it. Would I see it again? Probably not. While it's wonderful, once you've seen it there's no need to see it again. There is no song or scene that is so memorable I""d want to see it again, unless the tickets were free. However, it is an awesome play and I""d recommend it for anyone."	19	4	The Lion King delights even adults	rmonforton
214	October 25, 2012	This is a must-see show for families. A true classic and extravaganza. The consistent talen is terrific. We saw it twice over a couple of years and enjoyed it thoroughly each time.	101	5	A great show with an unbelievable opening scene!	Dave E
142	October 27, 2012	"The whole theater are a ""Lion King"" from the entrance to the stage. And it is in the center of Times Square. This play is a must see show with great actors and costumes. Its for adults as for kids. "	39	5	One of the best on Broadway	Øyvind D
80	October 30, 2012	I enjoyed this rendition of a Disney classic. The props, moves and costumes used to tell the story were ingenious and pleasing. The performances by all the actors were VERY good (although the adult Simba we had that night possessed a rather squeaky voice which jarred us from the fantasy of being in the story). The only negatives were the prices and we thought that the show peaked early. Truly, the opening act / score was the best part.	69	4	Enjoyable & different	Diana F
37	November 2, 2012	A real treat in store for all ages. Incredible costumes and fine acting performances made this Disney classic a must see Broadway experience. Fantastic!	28	5	spectacular show	jcfc33
84	November 5, 2012	What a special treat. Yes, it was very expensive but it ended up being our families favorite memory from our vacation. I recommend sitting on the aisle of the main floor. This will give you an up close and personal view of some of the animal costumes as they march by on their way to stage.	75	5	Worth it	Donegal1968
58	November 5, 2012	Enjoyed the costumes and set. Performers did a good job, especially the younger kids. Tickets were expensive but I guess that is NYC. We are a family of three and tickets were over $400. I kept thinking off all the other things i could do for $400 during the play. Like a whole weekend in the mountains in NC, vs just 2.5 hours in a crowded theater in NYC.	60	5	Great Set, Costumes and overall production	upontheridge
4	November 9, 2012	Awesome production. The Music, costumes theatre were all excellent! Nice to share with my 18yr old grandson. We both enjoyed it.	2	5	Lion King @ Minskoff Theatre	char351
86	November 11, 2012	Brilliant!!!! It made me cry and laugh at the same time, an absolute must see!!!!! Excellent for children!	50	5	See it! See it! See it!	Sheridan K
100	November 14, 2012	When we booked our holiday to New York, my mum, sister and I all decided we had to see a show on Broadway. We could have chanced it and tried to buy a discounted ticket at times square ticket booth but we didn't want to risk it...and in the end we didn't see any for sale on the weekend we were there it is that popular! The Minskoff Theatre is lovely, it is really central to Times Square and not too overwhelming in size. There was nice memorabilia for sale which I didn't buy but I think if you buy a drink at the bar you get it in a Lion King Juice Holder you can take home and I wish I had done that! The show itself was sensational. I don't have one negative comment for it and it totally lived up to my expectations. I love the film and had really high hopes for the show. As soon as it started I wanted to cry! I felt really emotional especially when the animals came on and the musicians and performers were all wonderful. There were nice moments of humour included as well and a couple of new songs added but it pretty much sticks to the original film. I just loved zazu, he was fantastic! There are billboards all over NY advertising this and I have to say it is one of the best things I have ever seen! Totally worth the money, we sat up at the back and the view was fantastic so don't worry if you don't want to buy a ticket for $170, ours were around $90 each and well worth every penny.	46	5	A highlight of our trip to New York!	V87
33	November 16, 2012	An amazing portrayal of one of my all time favourite movies. The cast were brilliant, the theatre was centrally located, the music was moving.. everything was perfect!	14	5	Phenomenal	Laura F
115	November 18, 2012	Its an eye popping spectacle that is worth every penny... looking forward to it touring Europe, hopefully the stage show will still be as impressive as it was in New York.	145	5	Breathtaking Show	Vincejd
56	November 18, 2012	The costumes were amazing, very entertaining. It was very well put together. I loved it and would want to see it again.	58	5	Magnificent!	alena_724
46	November 19, 2012	Could see it again, Costumes and music spectacular. My granddaughter has asked us to take her for Christmas.	14	5	Lion King	ritafcohen
2	November 20, 2012	This is a MUST. Absolutely breathtaking, the music, costumes, sound, singing etc. You HAVE to see this at least once in your lifetime. The tickets are a little expensive but definitely worth every penny. This is a show I will never forget. Absolutely fantastic.	12	5	lion king	SUSAN B
58	November 15, 2012	The Lion King is one of Broadway's must-see shows. It's a classic. I cannot say enough about how CREATIVELY they bring the Lion King story to the stage. Especially the way they do the entire stampeded scene. It's freaking awesome. GO.	33	5	Saw it twice, loved it both times.	kyoooootie
7	November 15, 2012	Went to this in NY and will go to when it comes to Dublin. A fantastic show. If you liked the movie, you will like this even more. Music is top class also and you won't regret going to it.	1	5	Better than the film	ontheditch
44	November 16, 2012	music, set, costumes I loved everything. I had a cheaper partial view seat and still saw everything. Some parts were so lovely it coulc\d bring one to tears	18	5	fantastic for all ages	barbacat

253	November 12, 2012	We went to the Lion King for my sister's 19th birthday, because she has been wanting to see it for awhile, and especially with growing up with the Lion King as kids. Her and my father enjoyed their time, but my mother and I didn't particularly enjoy it so much. We thought it was over-hyped honestly. The actor who played Scar, his persona didn't match the original Scar in the Disney film by any means, it was like he was a whole new character. Also, with the amount of space they had to work with as far as the stage goes, i though the set was too simplistic. Just wasn't a fan overall	71	3	Too artsy for me	mknabster
300	November 12, 2012	Fun to see live action and and they do some creative work translating the move scenes to sets / props. All the same music / plot as the movie (as you might expect), so you can pretty well judge how you'll like the show based on your opinion of the movie. Would be good for kids who enjoyed the movie.	99	3	Some cool sets / scenes, just like the movie	BlueTraveller711
153	November 12, 2012	it's amazing , and is similar with the movie....the clothes are wonderful and you can feel that you are in Africa,beautiful voices and songs!	48	5	cute broadway show	LuMatos
16	November 13, 2012	The costuming is amazing, and the music contained some songs from the movie and some great new tunes. A classic.	5	5	Great show	Nora W
84	November 10, 2012	Though slightly pricy, I strongly recommend this show on Broadway. The production is out of this world. I've been in event management for a long time and I can honestly say that the staging, sound, lighting, acting, singing and most importantly the puppetry and animal mimicry was absolutely MIND BLOWING! You will not regret seeing this show.	34	5	Fabulously Amazing!	SherifAbaza
129	November 10, 2012	We had pre booked this before leaving home from AU. The process of changing vouchers to admission tickets was very smooth. As for the show...simply breathtaking. 	70	5	Amazing!!	penml
79	November 10, 2012	I didnt think i would like watching a broadway show but i loved the Lion King! It was a great performance and is very clever how it is all put together! Tickets were quite expensive and we couldnt find discounted tickets anywhere but it was still worth it and it was a great show!	54	5	Fantastic show!	Pinkstarz77
133	November 10, 2012	I had a smile on my face the entire time! The costumes and the set design are phenomenal. Jaw dropping and awe inspiring. Sure you know the story already, but you will experience it in a way you didn't even know possible. It is a must see. 	62	5	Lives up to the hype!	MMCSydney
1026	November 6, 2012	"The Lion King is entertainment for all. The Broadway production is spectacular and mesmerizing. Though it is so hard to pick which play to see, I am glad we put this one on our ""playlist."""	316	4	A timeless favorite	Gran7
33	November 7, 2012	Just had to take in a show on Broadway. This was an excellent choice. Very entertaining. Cast were excellent as was the musical content. 	19	5	Entertaining show	sgdbdhd
134	November 8, 2012	We took our five year old grandson, and he was transfixed! Hardly even fidgeted! Music, costume, pacing, all excellent. Really fun for all!	51	5	Excellent show to introduce children to good theater	MajorNYC
78	November 8, 2012	We were so very fortunate to be able to attend this wonderful show this summer! I had seen it when it first came to New York, and it was just as great this time. Such fantastic choreography, costuming, singing, and acting! No matter your age, this is so worth seeing! Don't miss it!	24	5	Absolutely fantastic!	Jmcicero
153	November 5, 2012	The music from the opening act was so powerful and beautiful that I started to cry during it! I loved every minute of the show. Would definitely go see it again!	51	5	Wow! Awesome show!	flowerlady1024
9	November 5, 2012	Great show for all ages....amazing scenery and special effects. Loved the whole thing - and have seen it twice on Broadway now....well worth the money!	7	5	Awesome Show!!	kstapper
190	November 5, 2012	The Lion King has some of the best singing, dancing and costumes. Its a great family show everyone from kids to grandparents will be entertained. I highly recommend this show.	68	4	Everyone should see The Lion King, at least once	lbloveslife
41	November 5, 2012	This was an absolutely fabulous show - we were so glad that we chose to go and see it. Amazing from start to finish!!	17	5	Not to be missed!!	Linda K
22	November 3, 2012	We had an excellent time and both our girls loved it. Costumes are fabulous and scenery well designed. I can only recommend this show.	7	5	Excellent show for children and adults alike	FatNat04
18	November 3, 2012	Cannot believe that someone came up with this show as a musical. It's different than anything I have ever seen. If you see one Broadway musical, see this one. Everyone in the family will love it.	8	5	Best Musical	Samsnyder
67	November 5, 2012	Phenomenal Show!!! I have to start saying that nothing needs to be said about the music. It's just classic. This show brought back to when my son & daughter were just kids and watched the movie, like 1000 times, my eyes still got teary during the scene where Mufasa died. The vivid expression of the animals is definitely one the reasons this show is so successful. There is also a touch of humor, where they joked about Mary Poppins and some other broadway show. I  highly recommend you see this show, if you haven't, when visiting New York.	27	5	What an Experience	fbrito29
166	November 5, 2012	well what more can i say... Lets start positive; the good, costumes are amazing and you canevenn sometimes froget there are people within them, it can be funny, nice for the whole family specially children. visually amazing. The bad; expensive, there is lip singing (actors not signing or singing with electronic aids), the show is more fore children. there are better things out there evita or the phantom of the opera to name 2. So think twice. overall experince is good, you will like it. but it did not won me over.	90	3	over rated	oestepr
108	October 30, 2012	really a good option on broadway. the decoration and ambiance is perfect but the play is so childish. maybe 10 years before it would be something but now it is not.	94	3	good decoration but childish	gorki222
40	October 31, 2012	the best show i ever seen in my life, comedian are just great, the theater is beautiful, thank you so much for this great moment!	11	5	great	jean g
2	November 1, 2012	Incrediable. Do not miss this, perfect for all ages...I have wanted to get to New York to see this performance. It was every bit of what I had hoped and promise that no one will be disappointed. A once in a lifetime experience (hopefully more)	17	5	I waited a long time to see this...	Nordblom
149	November 1, 2012	This is our second time seeing this show. Excellent, excellent, excellent. From the minute the animals come on stage until the curtain falls you are spellbound. If my wife has her way she'd go back to see it a third time. Me, not so much!	91	5	A Must See	Traveller200247
211	October 27, 2012	We had already seen (and loved) the Lion King in the West End and Broadway did not disappoint! A wonderful show, performed by an excellent cast. We also enjoyed pre show Lion King themed cocktails- although not cheap, definately worth it!	133	5	What a show!	Emma H
4	October 27, 2012	We went to see this play with all the kids and we really enjoyed it, great performance one of the best on Broadway, no wonder they are running for more than a decade. nice story , the plot, the scenery, and the set just perfect. It was simple a great!	23	5	Brilliant!	Claire G
155	October 28, 2012	I don't like plays, but The Lion King is really amazing, it's beautiful and different, the music was great, and the customs amazing!	42	5	This is THE PLAY!!! THE BEST OF THE BEST!!!	Juanomarca
55	October 28, 2012	The scenery and effects were excellent however the vocals were average. You must know the story otherwise you would be lost, especially regarding the Rafike who does not portray a baboon or a central charactor.	23	4	Very Good represention	Peter L
18	October 25, 2012	Inspiring and uplifting theme. The music reflects this as well. The performers respect the audience. It is amazing that they have done so many shows and yet ours seemed so fresh and the performers seemed so enthusiastic. Parts of the percussion section are out in the audience. What other musical has puppets. Fabulous art.	3	5	Not like any other musical you have seen	tonyb48
9	October 26, 2012	Excellent!!!!!!!!!!! Sound, costumes, stage...the sound was wonderful and we were in the upper balcony. The costumes and stage movements were always changing	2	5	Excellent	lyn e
74	October 26, 2012	What a wonderful play, the hard work in the actors, the creatures, and the costumes is simple amazing. I would reccomend every one that has the chance to see this play to do so. Breath taking!	23	5	Fantastic	DOLPHIN0308
169	October 27, 2012	Had a great night at the Lion King. Was a bit skeptical beforehand but the slick show with amazing sets and costumes won me over.	80	5	Slick, fun, and dazzling sets & costumes	SouthPerthAustralia
6	October 23, 2012	Loved the show but wished we had gotten seats in the Orchestra. Our seats were in the 3rd row of the balcony and would have been great for most shows but the costumes in this play are incredible and I think we would have appreciated them more if we had been down lower,	4	5	Great Show!	trvlplanner
43	October 24, 2012	Fantastic music, costumes and story. I have seen it 3 times and it never gets tired. Great for kids. buy the CD before going to get familliar with the music.	17	5	The Best Show on Broadway	Nicholas C
198	October 24, 2012	I remember taking my daughter to see The Lion King when she was seven. How much fun going to the Broadway performance 18 years later! We had seats on the front row of the balcony. Twice characters were standing right in front of us! The costumes were amazing! The children were a joy as well as the rest of the cast.The percussionists were great as well. I went to the show more for the nostalgia, but enjoyed every minute of the performance. Had quite a few good laughs! Not just a show for kids; it's something for everyone to enjoy. My one minor complaint is there was a heckler a few rows behind us. We were surprised the ushers didn't nip that in the bud pronto.	113	5	Delightful	CCR227
167	October 24, 2012	This was our first and only Broadway experience and it was quite spectacular and thoroughly entertaining. We had seats in the 'Orchestra' and they were excellent. There were cushions available to place in the seats to elevate children and these worked well for our kids (5yo and 6yo) who sat on the edge of their seats in awe all night!! (cushions were beside the theatre doors). It was a super show, highly recommended. 	83	5	Wonderful first Broadway experience	eccythump
33	October 20, 2012	The best musical that I've ever seen! Even, considering Les Miserables, which i watched in London. The artists performance is just amazing!	21	5	Must go!	Jackie_HK
95	October 20, 2012	Great for the whole family as well as the child inside all of us. The costumes are brilliant, choreography too great fun.	12	5	Family Fare	Kevin F
26	October 21, 2012	The Minskoff has been totally designed to stage Lion King, so the decor, stage lighting etc. is all tailored to the show. The initial music will give you chills it is so haunting and beautiful. Performers are in the audience several times. Costumes and the stage are typical Disney Fabulous. We were ages 19 to 66 and all thoroughly enjoyed the show. Probably not a bad seat in the house. We were in the lower part of the highest balcony and had great seats. Be sure to watch the two percussionists on either side of the stage. They are amazing.	30	5	Beautiful Show	Kathleeny
16	October 22, 2012	Truly an art spectacle that you have to get tickets for, no matter the price. A trip to NY is not complete until you see Broadway and this show is one of the best that will leave you memories for years.	9	5	If your in NY, you better see this	fltsimgv5
437	October 16, 2012	This one of the best shows you will ever see. For children and adults, the whole show is very well done and unbelievably entertaining! Don't miss it!	195	5	A must see while in NYC	iamarugger
129	October 17, 2012	My wife and I went seeing the LION KING - We bought seats at the second orchestra row, the tickets are called premium. It was really a fantastic spot to sit, we have earlier attended musicals from more remote locations, this spot was really fantastic and gave a real good feel for the products delivered.	108	5	Super duber	Lars_Krull
47	October 17, 2012	Certainly the best of broadway .not to be missed .... From music to story to costume ..... Everything is mind blowing .worth every penny !	18	5	A must for everyone visiting new York	TandonSap
24	October 18, 2012	Having seen the West End production in London a few years ago, we wanted to see it again... we were not disappointed	15	5	Excellent	Lordbinns
61	October 14, 2012	The costumes and stage setting - excellent. Theatre quite old so very crowded and seats a litle cramped but the show really made up for that. Had seats in the front row of the centre balcony A134/135 - excellent and cheaper price.	15	5	SUPERB!	MandR50
106	October 14, 2012	Awesome Animals. music, and dialgue was so like the movie - Rafiki unbelievable. Can't decsribe how amazing the opening act is - don't want to spoil it. Large cushions for kids to sit high uop and not miss anything. 	106	5	Awe Inspiring	MushuAnd
25	October 15, 2012	We were limited as to what tickets we could buy because they sold out so quickly. Worth booking in advance before you get there. No photographs allowed inside - and they are pretty hot on this rule. The show itself was amazing. Bright, inventive, great sound, loved the costumes and on stage scenery. It all certainly lived up to my expectations!	6	5	Lion King - well worth the price of the tickets!	Jill H
50	October 15, 2012	I have to keep this one short! Go!!! You will love it, it's the most incredible show and won't be disappointed	25	5	Best show ever	admiralhj
29	October 11, 2012	Was nice, good actors and a great scenario but a little bit expensive for a whole family. May be we expected more for the price and critics 	11	4	Good for children	Guillermo V
76	October 11, 2012	A classic Broadway experience. Fantastic settings. Strong vocal performances and a classic play  We had seats on last row on the mezzanine and view was still good. Facilities were nice and clean and organisation worked well  We can recommend both the play as well as Minskoff Theatre	65	4	Classic Broadway	PeterRavnRasmussen
11	October 11, 2012	I was so looking forward to this production as I missed it the first time around years ago. I have to say that I was left a bit flat. The backing props were a bit basic however the ensemble cast props were brilliant. The dancing seemed a bit flat, but the story was still as good as the Disney movie. I will go and see it in Australia when it comes out just to compare the difference,	5	3	A little disappointed	tony59Brisbane
6	October 13, 2012	You need to go and see this show. The experience is one you cannot repeat with any other show. Best show on Broadway	6	5	Amazing	Bryan M
55	October 9, 2012	Loved this show, but its not for everyone I suspect. Went with my parents and myself and my mum loved it, but my dad didn't really like it. I suspect it just wasn't his cup of tea. It can take a few minutes to get used to the puppetry, but once the songs kick in you just get swept away Really emotional as well.	54	5	Great Show	Niamhie82
89	October 9, 2012	Unbelievable costumes, innovative use of levers and pulleys to make people into animals. Great music, something for every age. The best broadway show I've seen.	122	5	Great show	Mungry
27	October 10, 2012	Best of broadway! The performances are amazing, the cenography is incredible and the soundtrack is now enriched by the cast.	32	4	Can´t miss it!	rgallodf
280	October 10, 2012	Being from South Africa and now living in the US this production made me feel very homesick, the beat of Africa still lives in my veins! but it was amazing, the costumes and props were great, the music fantastic - I would definitely recommend this show!	385	5	Spectacular	Harv and Les C
11	October 7, 2012	choreography and costumes are amazing, music and songs astonishing. overall great experience we'd recommend to all! only exeption: people munching on snacks, probably most of guests dont get the difference between movie and play	8	5	worth every penny	uliczka
82	October 8, 2012	I really enjoyed this show and am really glad we were able to get tickets! The actors were really good and the costumes were amazing! The one thing I wanted to point out is that you have a 15 minute intermission during the show where you are able to go and get drinks and souvenirs. During this time you should definitely try to get to the bar as soon as possible because once the bell rings for the show to start again it will not matter if you are in line, they will stop serving. This was very frustrating for some people.	41	4	Really good show	Roxxie35
14	October 8, 2012	This play was okay. I've seen better but I've seen worse too. The sets were impressive and the use of puppets was different.	6	3	Just Okay	sjbolden
8	October 8, 2012	The music, costumes, acting. Everything matches the legacy of the original movie. We paid extra for second-front row (row B) on the mezzanine. Although you miss some of action in the walkways, you get the best view of the stage with seeing the side.	7	5	Worth the extra money for prime seats	ScubaRobbie
11	November 20, 2012	"My husband and I attended the 15th Anniversary show. Words cannot describe The Lion King's unique beauty. From the breathtaking costumes to the unusual choreography, the show removes the audience from the Minskoff and transports them to the African savanna. In addidion, the music, such as Rafiki singing ""The Circle of Life,"" stays with you long after the curtain falls. Simba's awe-inspiring journey to King of Pride Rock is a moving experience for all ages. We cannot wait to see The Lion King again! "	4	5	Breathtaking Show	Christy45a
39	November 24, 2012	This was our four year old granddaughter's first Broadway show. We got tickets several months in advance so that she could have an aisle seat in the first few rows of the theater (left side orchestra was perfect)--extra cushions were provided to raise her up. Her proud grandparents and our daughter, her mother, also loved the show. It was a wonderful family experience.	8	5	A broadway hit for all ages	ProudGrandma10946
54	November 28, 2012	Show was great , all very talented actors including the children actors . Very entertaining.. Have seen it three times, You can get same day tickets at great prices in the box office. The animals are not life like but none the less brilliantly done. Just as the music and whole show is. 	21	5	A classic for all ages	Jellyachie
61	December 1, 2012	INCREDIBLE!!!! DON'T MISS IT!! I recommend the orchestra section and the aisle seat....and take a drink in the interlude!	22	5	Uauuuuuu!!!!!	AdrianKek
2	December 5, 2012	an near amazing and quite magical experience that our whole family enjoyed. we will be back again in summer 2013	23	5	great fun	daniel b
626	December 9, 2012	I love to see a show when I'm in NY and whenever I can. I love cirque de soleil, and I want you to know that this is the best musical I have ever seen, the only one that can be compared to a cirque de soleil show! The costumes are just spectacular and amazing, the music and the show to die for. Not to be missed!	288	5	The best musical ever!!	ManuLLosangeles
9	December 10, 2012	Everything was exceptionally well done, costumes were amazing. Would highly recommend to anyone. Would go again.	16	5	Fantastic Show	Lech E
209	December 11, 2012	"Great staging, costumes and puppetry, but in the end it is a children's story with no great songs and no particularly outstanding individual performances. This ain't ""Les Mis"" by a mile."	98	3	Mostly for children	richardjwaksman
962	December 15, 2012	Wonderful. Costumes, music, idea and performance, all together were amazing for all of us, big and small... Idea is great and it makes NYC even nicer even if it is crowded.	355	5	Beautiful for kids and above	Aburel
53	December 18, 2012	This show is one of the few Broadway shows worth the full ticket price. Great for everyone in the family. If you can't get a discount, go anyway.	29	5	Great costumes, great show	traveler61
45	December 20, 2012	Loved it. Theater is especially comfortable. The production is amazing. It is so well done you don't notice the puppeteers. 	36	5	Fabulous	taxi4umom
96	December 23, 2012	It's not your typical musical, but if you love the story and the music you'll love it and I was deep within the story for the full two hours. The staff down stairs were very polite and efficient in hearding tourist upon tourist to their correct door, however I found the ushers upstairs to be quite rude, unnecessarily so. The view from the theatres of Times Square, is also a mega bonus - it was a great photo taking opportunity.	34	4	Excellent	Katiekatie119
2	December 28, 2012	After going on the Insiders Shopping tour, tourguide Jeffrey talked me into doing the Brooklyn neighorhood tour the next day (December 8th 2012). I wasn’t disappointed. Walking through Brooklyn with ‘Uncle Jeffrey’ is like stepping into a 19th century Charles Dickens novel. His appearance (long black jacket, high hat, moustache) blends in perfectly with the borough, where history is visible in 19th century red brick & rowhouses. His character (sense of drama & funny voices , he is an actor after all) makes him into a Dickensian character, rather than a tourguide, adding to the experience of the tour. All in all, Jeffrey is a very entertaining and informative tourguide. I really enjoyed his tour and definitely recommend booking a tour with Inside Out Tours.	3	5	The Brooklyn Bridge and neighborhood tour	IlseMarieScheffers
17	December 30, 2012	"A great show! Unfortunately I was a little jet lagged and fell asleep just before ""hakuna matata"" and woke up to the lady beside me looking at me weirdly clenching her child. "	13	5	Lion King, lives up to its name!	o-Traveller-M-o
23	January 1, 2013	I've been to several broadway shows and this one was by far my favorite. The production value is top notch and I haven't seen anything like it. Highly recommend going if you are in NYC for a few days.	11	5	Awesome Show!	ffej84
13	January 3, 2013	Great play for either adults or kids!!! both my husband and son in law were surprised at how much they enjoyed it. Worth seeing more than once.	6	5	Loved it.	CaboLaura
19	January 6, 2013	Just brilliant. A must see in New York. It make me feel like 10 years old again. Expensive but definitely worth it.	10	5	Brilliant	kredechamp
61	January 6, 2013	we attended the Minskoff Theatre on 5th january 2013. we were sat in the 2nd row of the upper mezzanine and right in the middle. we had an absolutely fantastic view but no matter where you sit in the theatre you will feel like you are part of the show with actors appearing to the right and left of you. just an absolutely brilliant show! unbelievable! worth every penny!  The whole show was just breathtaking! Made our first trip to New York even more spectacular.	47	5	MUST SEE!	MRSHWALKER
202	January 7, 2013	We took our 14 month old and had front row seats on the mezzanine level to the matinee performance. He was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. We were thoroughly entertained!! Worth every cent.	213	5	A classic wonderful show	WheresDuke
16	January 7, 2013	This was a great first family trip to New York. The kids as well as us adults totally enjoyed our experience at the Minskoff Theatre. We saw Lion King and were not disappointed at all. The musical was outstanding. There really was no bad seat in the house. We sat kind of in the middle on the middle level and still saw everything that came out from the stage, sides of stage, sides of doors on different levels where we sat. Stuff everywhere. Absolutely breathtaking.	7	5	Wonderful to see the Lion King on Broadway	Sherry F
15	January 8, 2013	Maybe due to heightened expectations, we enjoyed the Lion King, but weren't blown away. The costumes and stage direction are the highlights, but some of the acting and singing were lacking. Best among them though, were the bird guy and the owl lady.	13	4	Lion King a satisfying theater experience	rsekeres
41	January 4, 2013	I will never forget my family's outing to the Minskoff Theatre to see the Lion King. We paid dearly for the tickets (center balcony) since my Mom asked me if we could 'maybe find some tickets' spur-of-the-moment...but the experience is nearly worth the price of admission. The production is both classic and fresh, primal and other-worldly. Don't miss seeing it before it closes (some day...)	19	5	My jaw dropped (literally!) as the life size macrame elephant entered the stage!	ThereseS
5	January 5, 2013	Amazing, the show was great and we were treated very good. Please go see this show when you visit New York!	4	5	Show	Shirley M
55	January 5, 2013	The costumes and music were amazing. We were very surprised by the show. You have to wonder how they will do this show justice; we left in awe. Unbelievable!!	66	5	Awesome Show	CanadaAdab
4	January 6, 2013	Outstanding performance that really captures the Disney Classic Film! The costumes will take your breath away and were so creative and cleverly put together. A show that we touch your heart, have you in fits of laughter and give you goosebumps. The actors are fantastic and a must see if you visit the city! A moment I will forever cherish in my life time!	1	5	The Best Show You'll Ever See!!!	ALittleTravellerUk
58	January 2, 2013	Wanted to introduce 10 yr. old grandson to Broadway play over Thanksgiving weekend. He has not had much experience with live theater and thought this play would be perfect and it was. Although the story line is weak the music now more than familiar to everyone unless living under a rock is easy to hear but it, of course, is the staging that wins the day. Even though I was familiar with the reputation of the staging it wowed me more than I thought it would. Julie Taymore is a genius. Glad I saw it.	45	4	Perfect Introduction To Broadway	travelaround48
70	January 2, 2013	This is a fantastic show and well worth it! I would recommend this show to everyone and especially to those that might not want to see a live show.	47	5	The Best!	DanWin53
59	January 2, 2013	I took my daughter and her friends for a weekend in NY. This was her 16th birthday and she has been a Lion King fan since she was a kid. Even though she had watched the DVDs numerous times and had the movie memorized, the costumes made this a fresh experience. We sat in the balcony. My friend who is used to orchestra seats suggest that would have provided a better view of the scenery. So if you can afford it go for it!	30	5	Good Solid Family Entertainment	KayBee698
19	January 3, 2013	"The show was very entertaining and my family all loved it. This was our second time seeing the show, but it was still a great treat to see on New Year's Eve. The only thing I did not like was the ushers. They were yelling at everyone to sit down before the show started after intermission. They were not polite about showing you were you were supposed to sit and were just more like ""police"". I know it is a big place and you need crowd control, but one of the older ladies was just mean. At the climax of the show, during the last song, the usher lady saw some guy take a picture or pull his phone out or something and she ran up to him and said she needed to see him at the end of the show and then proceeded to stand in front of us for awhile pointing at him, etc. We could not see the end of the show and the usher really distracted from it. Could she not have waited one more minute for the curtain to go down??? Really!!! It ruined the ending for me. Other than that (and that a kid across the aisle who threw up during the show), the show itself was extremely entertaining and I do recommend it."	18	4	Great show...(but)...	Tinsman5
10	December 31, 2012	I was so happy when I got 2 tickets for the lion king musical on Broadway! Now I fully understand why they call this the best show on Broadway. Impressive costumes, decors etc. Worth the price!	1	5	WOW!	globetrotter_travel8
616	December 31, 2012	I took our granddaughter to NYC for her birthday 12 on 12/12/12, how about that. So I made sure to get seats in the Orchestra close to the aisle so she could see up close the action in the aisles. She loved it and as always the show did not disappoint!!	164	5	Great time, great seats	fjmccarl
29	January 1, 2013	This show is amazing. We thought the same show in London couldn't be beaten but this show was equally amazing!	19	5	Amazing!	Dominic37
7	January 1, 2013	Beyond my own expectations. Almost missed it as out travel arrangements got us to NY much later than coordinated. But it was worth it. The voices, the choreography, specially the costumes. Forget about it!	1	5	Extraordinary	WarrenRodz
33	December 28, 2012	What an incredible show...from the start to finish. The singing and the music is wonderful but, wow, the costumes, puppetry, and sets - amazing! The creativity is mind boggling. I loved every moment. My kids are 12 and 14 and also loved it.  A note on the practical side... no need to dress up for the theater anymore, I guess. People wore just about anything. I even saw a boy in a soccer jersey. Maybe because we're all tourists?  Definitely worth the time and money.	14	5	Oh wow.	Carol M
122	December 29, 2012	I have seen the Lion King in both Toronto the first time and now New York. It is a wonderful production and must see.	44	4	Excellent Production!!	dreamweaver227
30	December 29, 2012	Great costumes, funny and good show. A must see show for families who want to let their kids experience Broadway	18	4	Great show for the family	sknoopy
16	December 30, 2012	Wonderful but not only a family show, it's much more than that. Good for all ages. Excellent and would recommend to everyone	8	5	Lion King	DanzaMartin
22	December 24, 2012	wow amazing -please go you would not be disappointed. 2nd time my daughter and I have seen it and it was just as good 2nd time.	17	5	My favourite show	Denise232
5	December 25, 2012	absolutely a must ! just hope you will see a good cast and you gonna fly to the theatre roof , its an amazing experience . 	2	5	the king of broadway jungle	Eran S
56	December 26, 2012	super show - groundbreaking in costume design. very entertaining in terms of music and visuals. I would definitely take others who have not been to this show	13	5	super show -	NYReliable
2	December 27, 2012	This is a must even if you don't have kids. The cast were just fabulous and the music is beyond your imagination. Try to get there early so that you can enjoy the surprise!! Yes there is one!!	16	5	Awesome	Lloyd I
45	December 21, 2012	The music is very good, the cast is great but the scenografi is fantastic!!!! The theater is comfortable and the seats are ok - nice legroom.	22	5	A great show	UBLissau
74	December 22, 2012	We loved the show and were able to take a back stage tour which was awesome. The kids were able to see & hold the props. We went during Broadway cares week and made a charitable donation to do the tour with one of the cast members	17	5	One of the Best	jerry w
24	December 23, 2012	A thrilling 2 hours. not being allowed to take photographs was understandable but a dampener. Brilliant star cast and lot of thought behind the entire show	6	5	Spectacular	Rajan_patna
31	December 23, 2012	Seems like this is the only show that doesn't offer discounted tickets. I spent over $150 and landed on the first row of the Mezzanine. The performers are right in front of me at the opening and right after the break! Performers are great, singing is great, costumes are great, stage design is great, etc. (I can go on and on.) The way they represent the animals is simply genius. All parts of the performance are great. The show is suitable for everyone - kids, family, couples, elderly. But the seats are hard to get so book in advance if you are travelling as a group.  I also paid a visit to the Lion King exhibition couple of blocks away. Finally a place where you can freely take pictures of the amazing costumes! The staff are very helpful and explain in great details the symbolic details of the costumes. It's a shame that the exhibition is not permanent and has ended.	22	5	Just cool and impressive	olivia_yeung
30	December 18, 2012	"Normally I can rely on Disney to produce great shows and parades, so my wife and I had high expectations going into the Lion King. Unfortunately we were left very disappointed. We found the opening was quite intriguing, but once the ""new"" songs starting flying about, and the acting started to waiver, it was really quite boring watching it. Some of the technical aspects of the show were amazing no doubt, but the actors just weren't pulling it off. We also found it a bit strange when they received a standing ovation at the end, when it clearly didn't deserve it....really removes the importance of a standing ovation when it happens just for the sake of it. I would recommend looking at other show options in Broadway."	26	2	A Disney Disappointment	TravelGod82
33	December 19, 2012	I really enjoyed the Lion King but not as much as I have other musicals. We sat in the middle which was good but the seats are so close and a little uncomfortable. I also didn't think the talent was quite as strong in the lead parts as I have seen at other shows. The costumes were amazing and how they did all of the scenes was quite impressive. Definitely worth it but I wouldn't probably go again.	9	4	Impressive costumes	Jminor50
7	December 20, 2012	I was invited to see the Lion King musical this month in New York. First, this is my favorite Disney movie. Second, I must say, it was beautiful. First Broadway experience, and maybe best. I cried during the intro because it was so overwhelming and the set, and costumes and makeup. It's just amazing. A must-see! It's a classic for a reason ;)	3	5	Best gift ever!	Loulwa K
166	December 20, 2012	Loved it! Costumes are amazing. I've now seen Wicked, Phantom of the Opera and Lion King and Lion King was by far my favorite! So good and worth every penny spent!	56	5	Seen several musicals in NYC and San Francisco and this was the best	ctunnell
111	December 16, 2012	Fabulous show! Great songs and great staging. The views over Times Square from the lobby are great too! Not to be missed.	80	5	Fantastic!	simon t
2	December 17, 2012	The costumes and setting were remarkable. Go check out the exhibit in NYC that shows all of the costumes close up!	54	5	A must see	Heather C
52	December 17, 2012	it brought back all of my childhood memories of that movie. They made the story of the movie comes from the screen alive with dancers, costumes, music. The performance was captivating. Great production. a broadway show you must attend if you're ever in New york!	15	5	amazing must not miss!	sara B
155	December 18, 2012	A perfect example of how actors can go beyond their comfort zones and create the illusion of Pride Rock and The jungle for their audience.	75	5	Spectacular Lion King	weddingfan
63	December 11, 2012	My hubby and I really enjoyed the show. You sit so close to the stage and all the costumes were fantastic. It doesn't matter what your age you will love it!	54	5	Fantastic	bevhen
63	December 12, 2012	I will start out with this...I am not a theater goer by any stretch. However, my wife and I really wanted to go to a Broadway musical. I had been told by many musical goers that this is the play to see, so we bought tickets and went. It was absolutely amazing to see everything come to life! It really was a fantastic play. I can't recommend this highly enough. As far as the theater goes, there really isn't a bad seat in the house; however... I would recommend sitting as close to center stage as possible (at least the center section). We sat in the orchestra section row U seats 114 and 115 (dead center of the stage). You do not want to be up in the front for this play. I would say no closer than row M or N because there is so much that goes on around you in the audience. If you can get the tickets for much cheaper through a place like ticketsatwork.com (I am NOT endorsing this website because I did not use it...however, it was an option from my employer) or similiar, you really can't get a bad seat there. We paid the premium to get the centerstage, which I am glad we had those seats, but if the seats were much cheaper, I would have taken any seat in the house with probably the same feeling walking out as I did with our premium priced tickets. If you are in NYC, I highly recommend going!	25	5	Unbelievable!	bdeternv
54	December 13, 2012	"Well done version of a Disney tale. The choreography, set design and costume design were amazing. The cast was exceptional. It was a little sleepy at times but the two trademark ""Circle of Life"" scenes were priceless. We sat in the right Mezzanine of the rail, the whole stage was not visible so watching from a center section would be better.  For adults, I think there are better shows to see but for a true Broadway experience...big stage, big scenery, big cast, big production; it's great."	59	4	Great set and even better costumes.	ccham
43	December 15, 2012	Worth the expense. Small theatre meant a more intimate experience and plenty of good seats, but we sat at front of mezzanine and had great view. Spectacular show, great music, impressive staging and effects. Memorable !! Give this one priority for a great theatrical experience. 	25	5	WONDERFUL !!!	2adults2teens
44	December 11, 2012	Amazing show, beautiful voices, great costumes, very overwhelming. For those of you who are kids inside. Dont miss it	10	5	great show	Christina N
32	December 11, 2012	Love all these prewar theaters ... the show was amazing .. the costumes were exceptional. A must see if you've never had the pleasure before !!	34	5	FABULOUS	DeniseandLazaro
31	December 11, 2012	Anyone who hasn't seen this show should see it--especially if you have children. But this is a show for all ages. Colorful, imaginative, amazing feats duiring the show, good music. Just a rare treat. Its been around for years and with good reason	14	5	Good for all age groups	mickey75
16	December 11, 2012	Amazing. Fantastic, loved it, loved the gazzells and all the animals, especially the giraffes. music was magic. well done to the cast	8	5	LionKing	annerobson
91	December 9, 2012	I loved the movie and wondered how the show might translate. Loved how the actors used the props as animals. We paid about $120 I think, which I think was expensive for a show but it was on Broadway. If you don't mind which shows you want to watch, I'd just go for the on the day tickets which are up to 50% less. The theatre wasn't too big and easy to see the show, even if we were pretty high up.	11	4	Great show	maoritraveller
49	December 10, 2012	The show was sold out. But, they suggested that we check at the box office of the theater on the day of the show in case there were cancellations. We did, and there were. We wound up in the Orchestra section, center stage, about 15 rows from the stage. It was amazing! The first 5 minutes are worth the price of the ticket. 	16	5	Lucked out!	MNKathy_12
54	December 10, 2012	Right now, at the theater, there is a wonderful exhibition of the costumes, masks, and various other theatrical accoutrements that made the Lion King such a splendid Broadway show. It is only on until Christmas, but it is very much worth seeing.	17	5	Something special for Christmas	Kathy D
5	December 10, 2012	This was the highlight of our trip. The enter production was amazing! I loved the giraffes - not sure how they could walk but they looked so real. Costumes were amazing! Loved it !!!! 	3	5	The Lion King - Amazing!!!	Debbie B
63	December 6, 2012	The puppets are superb. If you can get an aisle seat when the animals come down. Just like the film.	31	4	The Puppets	John C
245	December 7, 2012	I saw Lion King in London, but as a Brit I have to say, the Americans do this productions the justice it deserves! An amazing production with fantastic music and sensational Costumes, there is also a free exhibition to celebrate its 15 year run not to far from Braodway	102	5	Only on Broadway	GoonerPaul1964
17	December 8, 2012	Our 4th time to see the Lion King, it was the 1st Broadway musical for friends and since we only had time for one, we chose this most increbile show	13	5	Lion King	RuthR53
25	December 9, 2012	It's an attraction for all ages, I can't say more than that. I can't imagine anyone leaving the theater thinking they got ripped of. This was one of the best shows I have ever seen with my family! (And by family I mean all adults) Book ahead! We took the front of the mezzanine section but I booked 3 months ahead. 	12	5	Magical in every aspect	MassExplorer
19	December 2, 2012	Along with my 13 year old son and 75 year old mother I saw this show today and I have to say bravo! It was a 2 time for my son and I and first for my mom and we all thoroughly enjoyed it! You feel part of the show when they walk down the aisles and the performances were so great. I would highly recommend for all	12	5	An awesome experience!	Carla321
7	December 3, 2012	When I saw The Lion King in New York, I first was flabbergasted and did actually have tears in my eyes when they sung The Circle of Life and all actors came on stage. I must say, they all sang great and the outfits were marvelous. I have to add though that I was also a bit disappointed as they put in songs that were in none of the movies, and also songs from the 2nd movie. Also, they have changed some scenes what I did not like at all (e.g Scar chasing after Nala, wanting to make her his wife....a bit odd) . It was always my dream to see that musical, but it did ruin a bit of my childhood dream :/	14	3	Astonished, yet disappointed.	Pa2201
228	December 3, 2012	Everything about this show is fabulous. The costumes, the scenery, the dancing, the puppetry and of course the actors, are beyond description. 	65	5	Artistically and Musically Magical	Winkie51
2	December 4, 2012	Much smaller theatre than expected - more intimate. Stage presence of all involved - definitely gives the wow factor!! Very moving - cried more than once!	85	5	Amazing	TillyB0
8	November 28, 2012	Great show. Perfect for all the family. The costumes where amazing. Loved the music. Very central theatre. We pre bought tickets on ticket master , they where the best value. 	1	5	Great for the family	Joe W
62	November 30, 2012	Well organized -ushers automatically bring pillows to help small children see the stage. Comfortable seating, well ventilated. Everything is very professional. Only drawback: VERY EXPENSIVE family outing	29	5	all ages welcome	Culinarium
52	December 1, 2012	Good show but not worth all the hype. Costumes and puppets were awesome but some members of the cast had a hard time hittng their notes. Great show for the kids though.	12	3	Average musical	johnchris46
14	December 1, 2012	WE had really been loooking forward to seeing The Lion King. Went to a matinee performance in October 2012. The costumes and sets were amazing. However the singing and acting was way below what we would expect of a Broadway show. Apart from Rafiki, the rest of the characters were just average or below average. The theater facilities were very good.	11	3	Dissapointment	Mahendri R
106	November 24, 2012	Perfection! We booked our tickets through expedia and the seats were great. The performance was riveting, even for my 9 yr old!	35	5	Worth every penny	B B
132	November 25, 2012	This is one of the true musical extravaganzas still being produced on Broadway. The staging is incredible, with mix of actors and larger than life puppets. Music, acting, dancing, story is all top-notch. 	62	5	Amazing Production/Happy Feelings	Corrie826
82	November 26, 2012	There are always great shows on Broadway, but there's a reason this one is still one of the most popular. Julie Taymor (original director) has a knack for bringing the imagination of a child to life. This production is no exception. The blend of human bodies with animal heads truly makes you feel like you are living in a world where animals can talk and sing. If you have children, this musical is a must-see. If you don't, you'll enjoy it just as much and you won't have to pay for the extra seats. Just go already!	31	5	Imagination brought to life	27sam27
158	November 26, 2012	I don't usually go to a lot of theatre productions, but thought as I'm in New York I'd go and see The Lion King. Absolutely loved it!! From start to finish I was captivated and was so glad that I saw it.	67	5	Great show!!	sun4oz
43	November 21, 2012	This musical was fantastic! I was a child when the original Lion King cartoon came out and I loved it then, so was very excited to see the musical. It exceeded all my expectations. The music, costumes, props, set and actors were all fantastic. I have seen a number of musicals and this one definitely took the cake. My husband is not a fan of musicals however even he did enjoy it! The musical is quite long, it is 2.5 hours but I did not get bored. I would go back and watch it again!	24	5	The best musical I have ever seen!	ihearteurope10
20	November 21, 2012	The best show for families in Broadway. This is certainly no. Classical musical, and the show can probably best fit in one of Disney's parks, but it is amazing to watch. I do recommend telling young children the story before going since it has some scary parts. The only drawback is having to deal with the theatre attendants that simply don't understand that their audience is comprised of families.  I do recommend getting tickets next to the aisle in the orchestra section so the kids can have a closer look at the actors. Until Annie and Matilda open this will remain the one show to see with young children.	13	5	Best show for kids	Viajeroabido
37	November 23, 2012	The show was nice. But be aware that the theaters are freezing cold. We considered to leave, and the cold nearly ruined my experience. I think this show fits best for families with kids. 	16	3	Freezing cold	JJ G
14	November 24, 2012	Seen it in London, 10 times better on Broadway! I cried it was that good! The costumes, stage set-up, actors e.t.c are out of this world and it is a must see! Memorabilia is a reasonable price and the theatre is beautiful. Lion King > any other broadway show. 	2	5	100% fantastic!	Chloe R
26	January 13, 2013	There are not many words you can use to describe the experience we had at The Lion King. i was utterly blown away	8	5	AMAZING!	tobesmcg
20	January 15, 2013	I have always wanted to see this play ever since it came out. The costuming, acting, singing were all phenomenal. The only disappointing thing is that my daughter and I had done so much that we were exhausted that night. I think you could see this play several times over and continue to pick up new things about it. 	3	5	A Play Not To Be Missed	Mamasuzz
27	January 16, 2013	I haven't seen this in Londons West End as I'd heard it was better on Broadway so thought I'd wait for my NYC holiday. It was incredible!! So much so that I would have happily say through it again. The costumes, music and dancing were fantastic and it was well worth the $100 per ticket.	18	5	Lion King on Broadway is a must!!	LJS_1985
30	January 8, 2013	Magnificent artists, colourful costumes, great music. I saw this show in Sydney 10 years ago and the New York show was worth the time spent queuing up for cancelled tickets!	12	5	Brilliant show	Robyn F
12	January 18, 2013	As I child I loved the lion king. To see it on Broadway was amazing. There was also an exhibition on where we got to see the costumes up close and touch them as well it crazy how detailed and light the costumes are. Great work	6	5	best show I have ever seen	washa24
142	January 23, 2013	Costumes and Music were excellent! Loved the way they danced around and up and down the aisles! Adults and children alike were in awe. 	48	5	AhhhhMazin! What a Show!	Luv2TravelwHim
50	January 25, 2013	It was a brilliant production and anyone that can should see the Lion King, the costumes, colours, singing and the children in it - we were blown away	16	5	Fantastic theatre production	Juliesydney
185	January 28, 2013	we got tickets the day before online and good seats too. The theatre isn't huge but the entrance and level looksouts are lovely. I resisted buying show souvenirs even though the range was pretty good - we donated money instead,  now the show- for anyone who doesn't know the story, it wont matter at all - it's a love filled tragic drama with one of the worse baddies on the screen /stage: Scar. We knew the story word for word - the songs are beautifully presented and sound glorious. the costumes are fantastic. There is not much to say against this show except I wouldn't see it again, my daughter felt the same - it's exactly like the Disney movie so worth seeing for the theatrical performances alone. Having said that, there aren't many shows I go back to - Jersey boys would be the only one.	56	4	I love this story	burra5
16	February 3, 2013	Liked it all. Dance, Music and costumes. The ability to take an animated movie to the stage and be able to pull it off as if you were really in Africa was outstanding	9	5	A loud roar	paul c
15	February 7, 2013	what to say about the Lion King, amazing music, great costumes and an unbelievable scenery, a true bliss. 	13	5	A must see	COTWGaParis
113	February 11, 2013	There is no words to describe this play. From the costumes, to the music and acting, it was by far one of the best plays we have ever seen. Well worth it.	33	5	FANTASTIC	SCFranklin
9	February 15, 2013	Great for adults and children a like. Amazing and clever costumes and brilliant acting. I really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it. If you go on the theatre's website, as opposed to other sites selling broadway tickets, the tickets seem to be cheaper. The only negative was the usher I encountered who was unfriendly and unprofessional.	1	5	Amazing costumes and acting	haz91
13	February 18, 2013	It is the story we all know from the Disney movie, with some extra songs, and a wonderful display of puppets, costumes, masks, and other marvelous sites. It was very easy to get to the theatre, get tickets, and had wonderful seats for a reasonable price. Overall the show was amazing, and I highly recommend it to all.	5	4	Great Experience for the Family!	PsycoChihuahua
14	February 23, 2013	WOOW! What a performance..really a great show I enjoyed being there and highly recommend it to anyone visiting NY it's a MUST!	154	5	Marvelous Show!	Maioza
4	February 25, 2013	This is the second time I've seen this show and it is by far the best broadway show I have ever seen! Kids absolutely loved it!	1	5	Amazing!	Andrea D
7	February 27, 2013	Wasn't really looking forward to this as much as the food when I visited the city but it blew me away! So much colour, music and action! I knew the story headed in but enjoyed watching it in person. Great job by the cast and crew!	2	5	what a show!	barrieonttravels
26	March 1, 2013	wow !!!! excellent beyond belief  Captivated by the dancing, singing and costumes it was an experience that my husband and i will never forget 	16	5	Broadway	Es12345
659	March 1, 2013	My wife and I finally went to see Lion King. It is visually outstanding but the plot is more for kids than seniors. We felt a bit like the only ones in the theater who didn't know the story by heart. Still, a good experience and worthwhile.	100	4	Visual Entertainment!	Jay F
167	March 2, 2013	"This is another amazing Broadway show. The representation of the animals and the ""landscape"" is wonderful! The history is the same as in the movie but seeing it without computarize animation makes a big difference. If you have kids, they will love the show!"	71	5	A magical show!	Enrique G
76	March 2, 2013	My expectations were not good coming into the show. How can you take a cartoon and make it on Broadway. Well, they did it! I was on a business trip and the whole time I was saying, my kids should be here to see this with me. Amazing!!	13	5	Take the whole family!	Thinktravelj
31	February 27, 2013	Great show, tickets not cheap but about what you would expect to pay $127. One annoying thing is the staff who seem to love shining torches at anyone who touches a mobile phone, very distracting.	17	4	Lion King	Highburydreams
94	March 3, 2013	The music and costumes were wonderful. My husband and I saw it before but this time we saw it through the eyes of our 10 year old granddaughter. She LOVED it.	34	5	Great Show	LMODelMar
80	February 28, 2013	This is a great show to see with your family. I've taken my daughter twice, once when she was 5 and now again at 7. This is a beautiful show, the music, the costumes, everything is just gorgeous. If this does not bring tears to your eyes at some point in the show, nothing will. My daughter loved it both times. If you can, get the first row on the mezz level. The kids will have to sit on their knees, on a cushion - which they provide- or on your lap becuase there is a black bar there to keep you from falling into the lower section and you can't touch it at all or someone will yell at you to get off of it - they are REALLY serious about this. But, you don't have to move around someone's head in front of you and you have more leg room. The theater is nice, but I was HOT both times I went there (both times in winter) so don't wear two sweaters or anything. I hope you see this show!!	64	5	Classic	Tracy M
163	February 28, 2013	The costumes and music/singing were outstanding, Show exceeded our expectations. Opening number is awesome and grabs the audience from the moment the music starts.	74	5	Exceeded our expectations	NoosaKings
4	March 1, 2013	This was my first time at a Broadway show. I was not at all excited to go but my granddaughter was visiting from Texas and wanted to see the show. It was fantastic! Costumes were incredible! This is a must see even for someone who thinks they hate plays like me. The tickets were about $120 each with fees. We drove to Hoboken New Jersey from Eastern PA and parked the car in a parking garage for $15. Took the ferry to Manhattan ($10 per person one way) and took a cab to the Minskoff another $10 one way with tip. Could have walked from the ferry but it was too cold that day. We had such a good time, so glad she wanted to go!	4	5	WOW	traveldottied
30	February 25, 2013	The Lion King is a visual marvel. The way the show displays the animals is simultaneously captivating and beautiful.  The plot line and songs follows the movie very closely, with a couple tiny wrinkles/improvisations added to extend the length closer to a standard ~3 hour Broadway show (including the intermission). The actors are for the most part funny/engaging. The Minskoff is a great theater. It offers outstanding views of Times Square on the way in, great sight lines throughout the theater, and the stage design is outstanding. I'd recommend sitting closer to the aisles (best view for the animal processions). Additionally, the bathroom line at intermission was the most manageable line I've ever seen. The only negative is the small bar/snack stand. The line here moves very slowly. 	26	5	Perfect for kids, but fun/engaging enough for adults	Michael S
5	February 25, 2013	There is only one word for this show... AWESOME. Great singers and wonderful performer. I was seated 4th row center and had an amazing view but I think that there is no bad view in the theatre. 	1	5	AWESOME	NC994
7	February 26, 2013	 Make sure to book your tickets 2-3 months early because they sell out really fast. We sat in the front row of the balcony and the railing was kind in the way so I had to watch the show without my back on the seat but the view was great. They also have dancers on the sides on the balcony and in the walkways of the orchestra sitting area. 	2	5	The show was amazing!!	ugniawoo
20	February 26, 2013	 I cried at the opening. It was absolutely breathe taking. I would see it again in a heartbeat! We sat in the first row, center, mezzanine level. I recommend this because we could see all the masks really well. If you are down below you miss alot.	22	5	Absolutely Amazing!	Lovethewhites
13	February 23, 2013	There literally is nothing to dislike... This was the highlight of my trip. Everything was perfect. Great acting, production, set pieces, lighting, costumes, singing, etc... 	6	5	I don't even know what to write...	James D
897	February 24, 2013	I had already watched The Lion King in Paris, the production is quite similar, but I liked it as I did in the first time. As other Broadway shows, it is expensive (around $90 the cheapest place). The place was only ok, but because of the people who did not sit properly, and not because of the theater.	245	5	Amazing!	LeoGM
180	February 24, 2013	My wife and I very much enjoyed the Lion King at the Minskoff theater. We were advised by friends to sit close to stage, because the costumes were fantastic. While the tickets were pricey, the location in center, row 8 Orchestra was worth it; and the costumes are indeed very original and engaging.	65	5	Not Just for Kids	Jim H
14	February 25, 2013	The show can only be described as magical,your transported to another land in minutes. We sat in orchestra section in the centre which was perfect. Lots of leg room,important for us as we're both tall.  We loved it & would happily go &see it again	7	5	A must see	catethepier
351	February 19, 2013	But........ this production just wasn't as good as that we saw several years prior in the Regent Theatre in Melbourne. This production didnt want for much, it just seemed the scale was a lot smaller than our previous experience 	102	3	The Lion King is never bad	Tartyone
3	February 22, 2013	Wow what an evening!! This is such a wonderful show! The effects are absolutely stunning. Such a great performance by all the actors! Our favourite was young Simba - he did a fab job!!!	5	5	Fantastic perfomance1	SF0rrester
10	February 22, 2013	Julie Taynor is a genius. I loved the cheetah ad the giraffes and especially the singing. Still can't believe it was so good. (My first ever Broadway show).	6	5	incredible experience	lwdooley
132	February 23, 2013	We were so excited to be on an aisle set the cast comes up and down them a few times. The costumes are really something else and the stage does a lot of special effects. Really neat production.	46	5	Good times	Shannon D
106	February 16, 2013	What a fantastic show totally recommend a must see . Go to box office for tickets as hotels rip you off 	64	5	Wonderful	joan17666
9	February 17, 2013	Absolutely wonderful!!!!! The costumes were to die for! The theater was really cold though. Burr. I would see it again, if I ever get the chance to go back to NYC	4	5	LOVED IT!	Kristin w
90	February 18, 2013	Everything from the acting to the costumes to the music and the actors voices to the theatre itself was in a word fabulous.	34	5	Fabulous	Wayne G
148	February 18, 2013	Disney does it right. I was amazed at the costumes. Singing and acting truly one of the best broadway musicals	40	4	Wonderful costumes and music	Valerie L
16	February 13, 2013	"The minksoff theatre is an ideal size for a show of this kind, allowing everyone regardless of seats to see the wonderful costumes. I thought the lions (in particular Scar) were brilliantly portrayed and the gentleman controlling Zazu was hilarious. I greatly enjoyed this performance - if I could have changed anything it would have been the enthusiasm of the songs. I recall from my childhood songs such as ""Be Prepared"" being incredibly zealous and forceful and I felt this was lacking slightly from the show, even though the vocal talent was incredible. All in all I definitely did not regret paying to see the show and would go back again."	7	5	Wonderful show with beautiful costumes	Wanderluster131
7	February 13, 2013	I enjoyed the show tremendously but the theatre ushers were extremely unprofessional in how they spoke to the customers. 	5	4	Great show	Phillyburbs1
50	February 13, 2013	Amazing production. We though it might be just for kids, we were wrong. Couldn't get tickets while in NY so we went to times square and a cop sold us a pair of tickets there. Great performance I highly recommend it.	23	5	Great Production	Pete M
682	February 15, 2013	The costumes were absolutely fantastic and so clever! If you're in New York - get along to see this!	280	5	Brilliant	sbspeedo1
23	February 7, 2013	The Lion King play was a wonderful entertaining evening. The theatre is beautiful. The cast and the costumes were amazing. It was fun to be able to be that close and almost feel like you were a part of the action. I would highly recommend the show.	7	5	Great play	Cheryl G
15	February 8, 2013	Very disappointed with the show . Costumes and young actors were excellent however some of the singing was way below parr . In fact at times it was like watching a school production .	7	2	Lack lustre show	Aj S
58	February 9, 2013	This is a great show for young and old. I totally enjoyed it. The animals seem so life like. The music and the show great.	18	5	totally enjoyable	erbl
6	February 10, 2013	We were about 12 rows from the stage in the center. Rafiki was excellent and the girl that played young Nala was also excellent. 	77	5	Perfect seats	Jennifer K
71	February 4, 2013	Loved it. Pricey though. Can't tell you how many times i saw the movie with my kids and the play followed the movie pretty well. Great costumes.	47	5	See the Movie first	KDHSc
19	February 4, 2013	One of the best shows I have ever seen. Fantastic for families. Puppetry, costumes and music are amazing.	8	5	Best show	AMCB3K
3	February 5, 2013	"What a great show! I wish we had stuff like this where I live. My kids won't stop talking about ""The Lion King"" its been almost a month and they're STILL obsessed with this show. I can't blame them either, I think I enjoyed it as much as they did!"	116	5	Best family night in a long time!	Taylor W
35	February 6, 2013	Beautiful costumes, wonderful singing and great for kids! The singing and dancing, are GREAT! Definitely a must do!	12	5	Outstanding show!!!	Robert J
54	January 29, 2013	This performance was very nice. Costumes were very nice. A lot of dancing. A lot of children at the matinee. I did like this show but I must say I enjoyed Wicked much more.	39	4	Very nice.	Peggy M
31	January 30, 2013	A great show. Our daughter had seen it on Spring trip with her class so we knew some of what to expect and were not disappointed.	17	5	Pat's gift from James and Krystal	FirstSam
7	January 31, 2013	Recently went to The Lion King with four families while visiting NYC. Eight adults and eight children from ages 8 - 16. Everyone enjoyed the show and the kids thought it was the best event that we did during our trip. Viewed the 8:00pm show which was mostly adults. Great costumes. Would see again!	7	5	Great show	PlylerS
77	February 3, 2013	This was not my first choice. I wanted to see a more adult edgy play. But alas I went and enjoyed it. Music, acting, story line. Costumes and make-up all top shelf. We sat in the mezzanine and the view was great. I could see the drummers/percussionist in their alcoves at our level. At the end when we stood for the standing ovation, a youngish clueless man seated behind us asked us to sit down, he could not see. But that's show biz.	36	4	Lion King roar	Cheryl Shepherd B
54	January 25, 2013	My wife and I went and enjoyed the show. She loves musicals, while I prefer plays and dance, but we agreed that The Lion King was an excellent, entertaining production. The costumes, set design and artwork are creative and stunning. But the music and performances were equally impressive and entertaining. If you want to thrill your kids get aisle seats as there are a couple of instances when the performers go up and down the aisles. Best would be aisle seats in the orchestra section to have the animals stroll by and thrill kiddos.	45	4	Excellent broadway musical for the family	Ironhorse70
40	January 25, 2013	This is the first show that our family enjoyed on Broadway so our expectations were high. We were not disappointed, as the singing, costumes and make-up, stage, and lighting were all fantastic. The theatre was sized perfectly so that there were no bad seats in the house as well. The intimate size made for a more cozy and personable performance stage. Overall a great show to see, especially for first timers.	27	4	Fantastic show, costumes and singing	rtpbutterfly
56	January 26, 2013	Would highly recommend seeing this show. It was fabulous! My 10 year old niece was in awe of the performers. The costumes and sets were extraordinary. 	23	5	Extremely Memorable Show	DebiSlaughter
5	January 27, 2013	An expensive evening out, but even if it was only one Broadway show, this is a classic that is a must see. Fabulous entertainment for all ages, it is a fun show.	72	5	Classic show ..,...	Denise S
168	January 23, 2013	I got last minute tickets for the Lion King and am so glad I did! It is a brilliant show..at times I forgot that the animals were actually people! The music was even better than in the movie and it brought back lovely childhood memories. I was in the very back row in the mezzanine area and had no difficulty seeing the stage. I would recommend this to anyone who loves Disney!	93	5	Beautiful!	fataliegarlic
112	January 23, 2013	We sat in the Mezzanine - terrific seats but we wished that we were in the orchestra - worth every penny. The songs, performers, costumes, sound quality, and production was amazing! Disney has the imagination and delivers. This was a WOW and we are so glad we went to see Lion King. 	63	5	Absolutely Outstanding!	KenBoston_MA
26	January 24, 2013	Very good entertaining show. All seating is good due to modern theatre, well organised starting on time	20	5	Great night on Broadway	mikemitchell21
40	January 24, 2013	So many amazing actors and beuatiful set designs! Terrific story line! Being part of a great audience helps too! Seating was comfortable although we could use a little more space in the aisles. Long lines to the ladies' rest room during intermission is the only con. Try to go just before the show starts.	33	5	Wow!	Joogee
8	January 19, 2013	Every time I see this show it evokes different sense in me. The story itself is entertaining and heartwarming but he costumes and set are extraordinary. These actors are part of something very unique and they earn every cent of their pay. They perform with such ease that one actually believes she is part of the jungle. This is one of my all time, favourite shows.	2	5	I could see this show a million times.	Judi_A_16
99	January 19, 2013	Great first Broadway show for anyone of any age for several reasons; 1.) Easy story line to follow (you don't need to see the movie or read the cliff notes) 2.) Never a boring moment 3.) There is something for everyone in this show!  Are you from out of town? A word of advice, if you plan on attending in the winter like we did, suck it up and grab a $20.00 black town car back to the train station. You might spend acouple dollars more than a yellow taxi, but they are readily available and curb any cab rejection that you might face.	61	5	Great 1st Broadway show!	l0ve_2_c_stuff
140	January 21, 2013	It was amazing from the costumes to the actors. Everything was gorgeous and we were honoured to be in the audience.	148	5	Like Wow!	tysontrip
127	January 22, 2013	At least once in life (I saw 3 times) you should see this show. Magnificent costume, great dance, beautiful songs, awesome.  People of all age can enjoy this show.	140	5	It's a MUST SEE	Dian M
139	January 8, 2013	We had the best seats on the mezzanine level,mthere was a cheeky family sat in our seats,mthey were moved by an usher! I think they thought we would feel sorry for them as they had children but quite frankly I couldn't care less, sick of subsidising people's kids all the time, move along, full price paying adults coming through!!  The theatre was comfy but not like a London theatre experienc, the 80s feel to the theatre was slightly alien to us! Loved the show and worth every penny, 23rd December so incredibly busy and had to fight through crowds to get there, ate at Maze before hand, really good, recommend reserving somewhere	169	5	Great value, we had awesome seats	SBerkshire
70	January 9, 2013	As a New Yorker, I went without much expectation and some disbelief that I was going to a Broadway show and shelling out a substantial chunk of change. However, must admit the costumes, the set design, and the music were all fantastic. Would have been five stars if the price range was lower, but overall a good experience and a memorable show. 	28	4	Great for Date or Family	Kicks_n_Bites
97	January 10, 2013	What saved the experience of seeing the Lion King were the fantastic costumes and puppetry. They were both exceptional. The music was so loud we couldn't hear the singing and sometimes wonder if it wasn't taped. The story line is an old one and the music isn't really memorable. Save your money and go to a Broadway production that couldn't just as well be enjoyed on TV. 	54	3	Lion King is overhyped	BinWoodside
4	January 12, 2013	I am not much of a musicals fan, but this Lion King on Broadway stage show was amazing. The set, cast, music and story was fantastic and worth every penny. We sat on the upper mezzanine a bit off center and we had a fantastic view. Great place to go with friends or take your children.	3	4	Fantastic Show - definitely recommend!	Travellingabroadgirl
83	January 17, 2013	I really enjoyed watching the Lion King. The costumes were absolutely amazing. I loved watching the giraffes and other animals walk across the stage. The acting was wonderful and a great experience. I was disappointed in the jungle set design. I was expecting more from set design rather than the minimalist approach.	37	5	Wonderful Performance!	Scrappy30
71	January 17, 2013	"I went to see Lion King at the Minskoff Theatre after hearing about it through the years from a co-worker whose cousin is the orchestra conductor at this long running musical and has pretty much made a career just from doing that! The show is incredible and we had orchestra seating about five rows back from the stage. My over 21 son enjoyed it as much as the little children in the audience. The colors and costumes and quality of performance made every minute there worthwhile! Because we had a ""connection"" we were able to have a private back stage tour following the show. That turned out to be just as exciting and incredible because we were astounded at the organization of all the props and costumes used and how they were stored. The expertise of the performers and back stage crew was very evident! We got to speak to some of the performers as they were leaving for the night after the show, also much fun and photo ops. Thank you to my friend for providing us with such a lovely and unforgettable evening!"	25	5	Lion King for Young and Old	sillygirl49
6	January 18, 2013	This was the second time I had seen the Lion King, and the first for my husband and friends. Every minute was AMAZING! We watched the Disney Lion King the night before to prepare and were blown away at the performance at the Minskoff Theatre. You really forget that you're watching people throughout the show - the animal like mannerisms, the detailed costumes, and creative sets make for an unforgettable experience. It's quite hard to refrain from singing along at times :-) We sat in the 2nd row balcony and it provided us with a great view and acoustics. I actually prefer sitting there to the floor seating. I would definitely recommend this as a family experience or for a fun date night. 	2	5	Amazing!	Cate216
9	January 18, 2013	This show is amazing...and we've been to several. I've seen it twice, once with adults and once with my family (5 year old son) and both times were incredible. My son was enraptured, I was moved and the entire audience loved the performances in the aisle!	3	5	You wont want it to end!	RebeccaHeath
319	January 15, 2013	broadway is not exactly always my dream for an evening in ny but some shows you can see over and over again. the lion king is one of them. the music, the decor, the costume are so memorable that everyone should see this show.	124	5	many years later still the best	annetteapproved
154	January 15, 2013	The performance was amazing, the theater located in a central point in Time Square where you can just walk out afterwards to Carmines for a super huge meal. 	71	4	Great performance and amazing cast!	Anna Maria A
6	January 15, 2013	Show was amazing costumes stunning we found the sound a bit imbalanced off to one side occasionally voices drowned out by the music	130	4	Great theatre	dys933
5	January 16, 2013	I was treated to this show in November as part of my birthday treat The show was marvellous. Music very good and you kind of forgot the animals were not real . The animation was superb. We were two adults who really enjoyed this show	4	5	Birthday treat	Anne842
74	January 13, 2013	It was amazing, costumes, live performance, you feel like being part of the play. Seating in the theatrre is very good, so people in front of you are not obstructing the view.	42	5	Fairy tale on stage.	Violeta K
2	January 13, 2013	I have seen this show before and I was a little disappointed, Simba as an grown up was played by someone who had some type of accent and for me it ruined it, wa snot as good as the production in Australia	3	3	Lion King on Broadway	CazP_13
56	January 14, 2013	I went to the show very, very long ago. And still I remember it! I think everyone who enjoys the story of The Lion King and good musicals should watch it. There is just simply nothing else like it! Great customs, make up and songs!	18	5	Classic!	FilipaM934
15	January 14, 2013	The dancers/performers were out of this world. The adaptation of the film to stage is incredible and I would watch this again and again and stil be blown away 	3	5	Left me breathless	Elle2301
143	March 4, 2013	I took my 2 sons and we loved the show. The actors do a wonderful job in their animal like costumes. It is a wonderful show and would recommend to anyone.	46	4	Great Show	Gregory M
31	March 10, 2013	A show that everyone should see at least once! One of the best shows on broadway! The effects were incredible and the costumes were breathtaking!	19	5	Amazing experience!	Lauren_OH_IO
59	March 14, 2013	I know I will be int the minoirty here, and I'm not a fan of Braodway musicals anyway, but my girlfreind bought the tickets and wanted to go. I loved the movie soundtrack when it came out, but I thought the show was dated and the actors like big puppets. 	17	3	To me just a ig puppet show with some good music	MacDiaz
26	March 14, 2013	The show is absolutely wonderful !!! My son loved it sooo sooooo much !!!! Excellent !!! It was a great entertainment !!!	17	4	great shows	YusufW79
10	March 18, 2013	What a great production. Thoroughly recommend. Beautiful and simple how they adapted for the stage. Sat on 4th row so had a great view 	2	5	Fantastic Broadway show	buddyizzy
20	March 21, 2013	The costumes, acting and singing were excellent. The theatre was very comfortable, even thou we were in the back, we had no trouble seeing or hearing the performance.	15	5	Amazing	Foxcar
14	March 23, 2013	I saw this one last year in Vegas and is SPECTACULAR!  Actors and Actresses are so professional, love the begging and the epic moment with the lion makes me shiver ! I have to say this : Guys if you want to impress a girl take her to this Play and she will fall !  10 stars to the stuff!	2	5	Spectacular	chris w
37	March 24, 2013	I'm from South Africa, so you think I would've seen this production long ago, however, it was my first time in NYC! And even though I'm used to African themed shows/events...this was a truly enjoyable night out on my Birthday. Everything from music, to acting and execution of the production was impeccable. If it wasn't so pricey, I'd go back again! ;)	11	5	Phenomenal	Kuls82
135	March 28, 2013	The Lion King was my first real Broadway experience and it has since been one of the most memorable performances of my life. I am a big fan of the animated film but this was an experience much beyond my wildest imagination. The entry of all the characters from the aisles, to the stellar performances and the wonderful music. Just magic.	84	5	A once in a lifetime experience	Pranay R
237	March 31, 2013	Its perfect, apart from the bits they add like scar wanting to be with nala. I see why they did it as it is a rather short story and they needed to find ways to extend it but id rather have disney as disney intended but because everything else was done so perfectly and the costumes were so amazing and the voices sounded just like the really characters!! It did miss a couple of the 'smaller but memorable moments of lion king and some were not said quiet right,' (when you have seen it as many times as me you may understand e.g they never did the 'sunda sannaa squash banana raffiki bit' and also things like 'not the birddiee boilaaaaaaa' didn't hit the nail on the head. But because everything else was near on perfect you can't really hold anything against 'the best show on broadway' 'the show that will keep on going forever' It was TEAR JERKING PERFECTION!! 	149	5	Amazing	Lee F
21	April 3, 2013	Fantastic costumes ! Great show with a few funnies threw in. Had very good seats in front row upstairs... Would recommend first two or three rows upstairs , if available , over downstairs seats because of watching the show from that particular angle. Expensive , but rated second best show in NY , next only to Wicked.	32	5	Brilliant	Dogbite6
67	April 8, 2013	Wonderful show! Great for all ages. Walk out humming the tunes. The actors as animals were amazing. Would see it again.	13	5	Great Shoe	MrsA5
39	April 8, 2013	Brilliant show! Have seen it before in London years ago and it was every bit as good as I remembered. Bought the tickets months before our visit so basically we could pick any seat. We sat on the Mezzanine level, right on the front row at the side and we had one of the actors right in front of us at the start of each act. If you want to see this show I definitely recommend buying the tickets before you arrive in NY to avoid standing in the huge line at the main ticket booth on Times Square.	27	5	Absolutely Brilliant!!	Janice G
78	April 10, 2013	i am not a musical buff and my two young sons had never been but when in nyc u have to try a show &it was brilliant.costumes,makeup,music and comedy 2hours of great entertainment and staff great too , especially as we had a wheelchair 	24	5	cant say enough!	BAABAAchops1
19	April 15, 2013	You will be overwhelmed with the talent, the acting, the singing, the costumes, the choreography.... EVERYTHING !!! A standing ovation !!!	9	5	Unbelievable !!	DParler
16	April 21, 2013	"Lion King is such an awesome show, from start to finish; the costumes, the music, awe-inspiring! The ONLY problem I have, which is actually incidental, is that I saw it the first time ""on Broadway"" and the second time, off-Broadway. (To be honest I'm not sure if my terminology or even my description is quite right.) I just know the first time I saw it I was blown away. The second time, my husband''s first in NYC, we saw it at the Minskoff and the setting made a difference to me, it lost some of it's magic. Having said that I would definitely recommend it for young and old alike! I don't believe you'll be disappointed! (BTW, we went a couple of years ago but I don't have the option of choosing when we went, have to pick from Trip Advisor's drop down list in order to submit my review.)"	11	4	The theater makes such a difference...	SuzieSparkles
68	April 24, 2013	I took my children to see this years ago and more recently took my grandchildren. It is still an amazing piece of art and entertainment.	15	5	The King is King	mauncha
18	April 25, 2013	This was my SECOND visit to see THe Lion King. Naturally, after seeing it the first time with my daughter and husband, I felt that it was a MUST for my grandchildren. The music, costumes, and effects were just WONDERFUL!	5	5	FABULOUS	CarolW7
86	April 26, 2013	This was our first broadway show. We loved every minute of it! The actors, the dancing, the music, the stage and back drops, it was all amazing!	42	5	What an amazing show...	Chelsey V
45	April 27, 2013	I really really really enjoyed performance. It was awesome. Thank you so much for beautiful memories. 	21	5	perfect	TakeMyAdvice12
85	April 28, 2013	So, I live in Florida and spend a lot of time at Disney World. For MUCH less, I have seen similar shows. Perhaps not as long. It was fun and the actor playing the young Simba was a standout for me. It is also exciting when the animals come down the isle, especially if you are sitting on the end. But for $200 a ticket, it needs to be out of this world and I was not blown away the way I was with 42nd Street on my last visit. I learned to save Disney for Disney World and next time will do a something with more typically Broadway next time. 	55	3	Hard to give only three but here is why...	Momofmandm
316	April 21, 2013	The visual effects were fantastic. It doesn´t matter if you´re young or old, this show is not to be missed. Everything about it is fantastic. We loved it and recommed!	1146	5	Fabulous show in NYC!	Rosana F
97	April 21, 2013	By far, the best aspect was the costumes. The actors truly evoked savannah wildlife. I never got tired of feasting on them! The story is identical to the movie with the difference being that the movie never lulled. The musical, on the other hand, lulled significantly about halfway through the second act, before picking up again for the finale. A great choice for families, but not quite sure it was truly worth the price of the tickets.	85	3	Visually appealing	fionapapa
16	April 22, 2013	Very touching performance! Who would have thought a children's story could bring so much emotion! I will admit I cried...  A definite must see!!!	14	5	AMAZING	MichelleDUB
317	April 23, 2013	A delightful production for all ages! The theater is very well designed, all seats are good! The costumes were very well designed. The young actors in particular were very impressive. Go see it!!	121	5	Hugely Entertaining!	Love2Travel004
74	April 16, 2013	What an experience, the show was magnificent, really, really, really enjoyed it. Especially in New York on Broadway! Would recommend it to all.	68	5	Excellent show!!!!!	VeraD21
44	April 17, 2013	An absolute must for allnages. I had seen this show in london and it was great. New york was out of this world. 12 points on a scale from 1 to 10 .	12	5	Must see	Jane B
24	April 18, 2013	It was awesome. I have been to Broadway plays before, but this was the best by far. The props and costumes were magnificent. The singers were great and the music was on point.	9	5	Greatest show in NYC	kenni523
13	April 19, 2013	OK, I was crying from the first note! Great music, beautiful! The staging was amazing, the acting good, but the South African type harmonies was so moving. The woman playing Rafiki was incredible, as was Mufasa. See it, worth the price!	13	5	Fun!	eddi s
25	April 11, 2013	Acting, music, set design, location - supurb! It was great fun. A must see for children and adults. Traveled from Chicago just to see this, and well worth the trip.	8	5	Memorable performance	Jerry G
2	April 13, 2013	Wicked and Jekyll and Hyde sooooo much better. Wanted to see this musical so much but I am afraid it did not captivate me as the other two musicals did. Husband and daughter dosed off a few times!	26	3	Disappointing, visuals could have been better.	Julesxxx333
7	April 14, 2013	Anybody going to NYC must see this! It will take your breathe away! I was as excited as when I saw the film for the first time (and then I was 8!)	15	5	Great show!	AndresDelB
29	April 15, 2013	Absolutely worth the cost! Colorful and amazing set. I enjoyed the music and acting was great! It is appropariate for all ages, children will especially enjoy seeing the characters right in the aisles. Note: You can not bring any food or drinks, opened or unopened in the theater.	9	5	Amazing Show!	Marcie R
97	April 9, 2013	I've seen at least 10 different shows but in my opinion Lion King is the best so far.... The atmosphere takes you into an African journey with amazing scenarios. The music was involving and exciting, Simply Great!!	59	5	The best Broadway show !!	makocwk
30	April 9, 2013	This show was fantastic! The costumes and just the whole production was absolutely fantastic. I would see this show again.	20	5	Fantastic Show	Melissa R
2	April 9, 2013	If you need to pick only one Broadway show to see, this is the one.  Is like being in wonderland: awesome colorful and impressing costumes, amazing performers with nearly the same voices of the movie, great scenario with magical effects that keep your seated at the border of your seat. This show will amaze children, teens, young adults, parents, grandparents and everyone! The Mezzanine offers a great view of the whole show at cheaper prices.	26	5	Just amazing!	Fran S
4	April 9, 2013	The show was absolutely amazing. Well worth going to see. Pricey but worth it for sure .we sat in the left orchestra area, but I would recommend the mezzanine, I think you would get a better visual of the whole show. 	1	5	A show to remember	Dessy80
3	April 8, 2013	"From the opening ""note"" you will be drawn into the coolest, most colorful musical of all times! The costumes look so real and the actors have a way with allowing you to view them as real animals. This is great for ALL ages "	1	5	Breath taking!	John K
29	April 8, 2013	Having been on Broadway for over fifteen years now, it's understandable that the show would not be nearly as exciting as when it first debuted. With that in mind, the show was a great experience. Children and adults in the theater loved everything about the show. While my fiancee and I had a fun time at The Lion King, our biggest problem with the show is that, at this current time in the show's life, it seems as if great actors and singers are trying to stay away from the classic musical. We bought tickets for a Saturday night showing, in the middle of a holiday season, and the actors who played several of the leads (including Simba) seemed to have problems staying on key. I can understand why actors may not want to associate themselves with roles that cannot get them awards or acclaim, but there has to be some great undiscovered talent left in New York. Other than that, the music, scenery, props, and choreography were a blast. The opening sequence with all of the animals was exciting, and the actresses who played Rafiki and Adult Nala were outstanding. The parts of the musical that were not word for word taken out of the film were entertaining, while the action sequences transformed from film to stage were very beautifully crafted.	28	4	A Little Lackluster after all these years, but still a good show	MichaelSantino
78	April 8, 2013	I have been to new York several times in the last few years and have put off seeing this show. I finally saw it and loved it. It will be one of those memory makers, just wait till you see the giraffes. If you havent seen this show by now please do.	54	5	Great show	Emmasjimmybear
139	April 8, 2013	There is nothing short of amazing. We took our 19, 8 and 6 year old daughters and all were amazed and wanted ti return. We had seats in W which was not bad . It was easy to see. Definitely a must see in NYC	97	5	Amazing even for a young child	Trinitraveller88
19	April 3, 2013	Worth every dollar! Unforgettable show that we will remember for a very long time. Children & adults loved it! Theater was clean & comfortable.	9	5	Exceeded Expectations	Jill L
15	April 4, 2013	I love the theatre but wasn't too keen on seeing a musical about animals. I'd loved The Lion King as a movie but wasn't sure how I'd feel about it as a play. The friend I was going to New York with isn't a big theatre person and this was a show she was willing to see, so I agreed - mediocre theatre is better than no theatre, right? This production exceeded my expectations by a zillion. The music, the characters, the way the story and the scenes were executed --- it was all amazing! At one point, when Rafiki is singing and the animals are moving around, it was so beautiful and so moving that I felt tears welling up in my eyes. I was mesmerized by everything from the very beginning to the very end.  I loved it so much that I went to see this again when it came to the city I live in. It was good, but not as good as in New York, where the stage is built for this production. Worth every penny: go see this play!	25	5	So beautiful, I cried	cdnglobetrotter007
134	April 7, 2013	Saw this with our granddaughter. Great show.The costumes and singing were great. Highly recommend this for family fun.	46	5	Outstanding	usmc63m
3	April 7, 2013	Good show no doubt but the price of sweets and drinks in the theatre are a complete rip off. Everyone pays enough for tickets to see the show in the first place so just felt it was very heavy handed to search everyone to the extremes they did and then bin any drinks and sweets found so you have to buy the very expensive stuff upstairs ( 2 x colas & 2 packs of sweets = 30 dollars +).	4	3	sweets & drinks rip off	GillianKelleher
11	April 1, 2013	The show was awesome! Well worth the trip! The drinks were on the expensive side, but we got a souvenir cup out of the deal!	2	5	Outstanding show	jdhoggb4
11	April 1, 2013	My wife and I saw this show at the Minskoff in March 2013. We have seen many broadway shows but this one is by far the best. We were seated in the orchestra and when it starts the animals come down the isles and onto the stage. The music is wonderful, the costumes are amazing, and the plot is very entertaining. The theater is also very nice. We would definitely recommend.	4	5	My #1 Show to See	James M
93	April 2, 2013	Great Broadway production. Nice show... Just love the music/story! Worths what it costs... Theater in the middle of Times Square, easy (but expensive) parking close by.	43	5	Must go	Diego40
14	April 3, 2013	This performance was outstanding. The 11 yr old loved it as well. She especially loved the costumes and the songs. In particular...she liked the old lady when she sang and danced. As it was my second viewing, i was comparing the first one i had seen to this and it was spectacular as the first!	3	5	Second time around	howdini
4	March 28, 2013	This was the best play Ive ever seen. Wonderful music, great costumes and set, talented performers. Nothing to complain about here.	2	5	would make a trip back just to see this again.	mary a
33	March 30, 2013	I have been to many Broadway Plays--over twenty--and I could not wait for this play to end. I know people who rave over this performance but my wife and I were bored to tears. Yes, the costumes are great and they do some incredible stuff...but it is like watching a movie with awesome special effects and no story line. You're impressed for a little bit and then, because you've seen it already, you're left wanting more. Few will agree with us on this one, but we did not care for this play at all.	36	2	Yep, I'm bucking general opinion here	HosProf
92	March 30, 2013	Book your tickets early!! This show sells out fast. Great time, any seat in the house would be good there are no bad seats.	35	5	Wonderful Show	nhscooper
551	March 30, 2013	Try for orchestra aisle seats to really feel part of the show. Admire the costumes and puppetry. Love the music. 	103	5	Rules the jungle!	Kulbi
18	March 25, 2013	Spent last weekend in NYC and went to see The Lion King. Spectacular is the best way to describe it. The staging and costumes were among the best ever on Broadway. This is a must see show, and bring the kids (although, kids under 5 or 6 might get scared at some of the action, so be mindful). What a great way to spend an afternoon.	4	5	Spectacular show & costumery	Glenn B
51	March 25, 2013	My boyfriend and I attended The Lion King on President's day. I was extremely excited to see this musical since EVERYONE talks about how wonderful and amazing and spectacular the performance is. I don't want to take away from the actors or the costumes or anything else that was going on during the day we went, but our Monday night performance was just Blah. First my boyfriend fell asleep, and then, during Nala's solo I dozed off. Maybe we had a long day. Maybe the performers weren't as enthusiastic as on a Friday or Saturday night (the night that most people who say this musical is AMAZING tend to attend). While the costumes were amazing, and the dancing and singing was swell, overall, I would say this was an average Broadway musical. I enjoyed Wicked more. I guess it's worth seeing since it's highly talked about, but try for a Friday or Saturday performance when the actors are tired from performing back to back performances the entire weekend.	28	3	Maybe It's Me?	Love J
1	March 26, 2013	First time to a broadway and this was experience for the first one! The seats were comfortable as well for the whole show was like watching it from your on living room	365	5	The best Disney	Jackie W
20	March 27, 2013	My 6 year old loved it...I would recommend other families to go...I'm just a bit spoiled and would rather see a larger production like showboat or wicked. great theater though...	4	3	Great Musical!	IntheMeantime
61	March 23, 2013	If you are going to NYC and want to attend to any Broadway show, this is the one to choose!! Tickets are expensive and we couldn't find any discount but it worths every penny! We went a Tuesday and it was cheaper than other days. Don't miss it!!	48	5	Amazing musical!!!	Marcela I
10	March 23, 2013	Saw this in late December 2012 and it was amazing, could not fault it - just wish the people in front had been a little more considerate and not talked throughout the first half.	10	5	Great Show	Longwaybear
178	March 24, 2013	This is a great production for all ages. The costumes were creative, and the use of dancers for set objects was fun too. Certainly the story and the music was a twist on the movie, and it was more interesting because it wasn't exactly like the movie as well. I thought the ticket price was a bit high for the size of the production, but it was fun.	57	4	Great production for families	Diane S
25	March 24, 2013	This show is amazing, its nearly perfect but being a disney fanatic i didn't like the extra couple of scenes the made up e.g scar wanting nala to be his. Should just keep to what disney did, i can understand they wanted to extend the length but it seemed a little odd. also when you are like me and no everline and its not said correctly or at all e.g 'not the birdy boilaaaaaaaaa' and rafaiki didnt do the 'a sunday sana squash banana' bit. But this cant get less than a 5 out of 5 because everthing else was executed to perfection. Up there with times square and manhattan skyline!! Must see!! Stop reading reviews and buy the tickets now!!!	24	5	Perfect, almost.	Gwen S
23	March 21, 2013	I wish I were a writer so i could give this production the credit it is due!! Everything was incredible the music, acting and vocally unmatchable!	9	5	This was a magnificent production!	TheJoyfulPalate
49	March 22, 2013	When visiting NYC, two of us went to see the lion king and it was absolutely amazing. Without giving much away, you wouldn't be disappointed. 	12	5	Fantastic!	RJ27Hull
28	March 22, 2013	Believe the hype because lion king is amazing. Great acting and fantastic costumes, far from the disneyesque I was expecting. A real cultural tour de force.	4	5	Memorable!	Andrew C
42	March 22, 2013	"A totally tired ""through the paces"" performance, with no verve or cast excitement to speak of + prices that were about 4 times what the show experience was really worth. Avoid it, buy the movie and enjoy yourselves for less than a fortune."	43	1	This Lion King performance was defanged	JohnD21C3
289	March 18, 2013	Literally, the opening scene was so powerful, I cried. The music, the sunrise, the singing, the animals...breathtaking. What impressed me most was the engineering that went into the creation of the costuming, and the artistry of depicting this film on stage. The stampeded scene was so creatively done...all of it was phenomenal.	136	5	stunning	hcvoyageuse
5	March 19, 2013	The quality of dance, voice and acting was the absolute best. It seems that even the fill-in actors were incredible. The musical follows the story and lines that you would expect if you have ever seen the story before, but with a professional quality that is subperb. The ticket was pricey, but well worth it. I would do it again.	7	5	Awesome show	David03_2013
7	March 19, 2013	This is truly how Broadway should be experienced! The Lion King's costumes and staging are over the top! You will fall in love with the young actor's who play Simba and Nala. But the actor who plays Rafiki will make you wish this character was on the stage more! The whole ensemble is brilliant.	1	5	Amazing Theater Experience!	Tal-travelers
35	March 20, 2013	The beginning, performance duration and the final are speechless! You are surprised in each song, the characters are amazing! The animals are unbelievable! The tks are expensive but worthy absolutly! I totally recommend to go to Broadway and do a stop here! 	13	5	Excellent performance	iwanttoknowtheworld
90	March 15, 2013	I bought seats before I went, but contacted TicketMaster directly in the US. The lady that helped me with the booking had experience of the theatre and knew exactly where to place us. The seats were perfect and part of the show was only feet away from us in the mezzanine. The show, costumes and singing was spot on and incredible on how they did it. You felt you were with real animals (ok talking and singing ones, but you get the idea). A fantastic performance all round.	43	5	Fantastic!!!	AndyandJackie
41	March 15, 2013	The effects of the actors as the animals was fantastic. Buy your tickets at the box office a few days before your desired date.	11	5	Nice play	Jim S
201	March 16, 2013	"This wonderful show was so enjoyable for our group. You know the story but to see the spectacular sets and hear the amazing voices of the actors was really a treat. Our family really enjoyed it. I loved when the performers came from the back of the theatre through the audience on to the stage. You could really appreciate their amazing voices. This show was on the top of our NYC ""to do "" list and we were not disappointed. "	79	5	Spectacular! For all ages!	wellsdp
6	March 17, 2013	Totally brilliant show, with an amazing cast. We loved it. We booked via Expedia and got great seats just 3 rows from the front. 	5	5	Amazing Show	Claire B
43	March 14, 2013	"I was looking for a Broadway play that would be fun for the grand-kids who are 9 & 11. My 20 something son was also going with us so I wanted something we could all enjoy. This was the perfect fit! Beautiful colors, music and costumes. Lively and interesting stage craft. Even though we all knew the story, and it was predictable, it was still interesting to watch. Try to get a seat near the aisle if you go, but don't sit a small child on the aisle! A fun, family show we all had a good time. The only complaint I have is that they did not open the doors until 1/2 before curtain time on a very cold day. This would have been fine except the web site said doors would open 1 hour before- so we were freezing on line. When I took the kids inside to warm up (in the ""box office"" area, where there was no crowd and plenty of room) We were, pretty rudely, shooed away. The show was worth the wait but-staff might benefit from a little ""customer service"" training."	14	5	Great play for different age groups!	NewyorkLH
403	March 14, 2013	Had great seats. Had a great time. The show was amazing,had a great time. The costumes are beautiful. The music is wonderfull. Fun for kids of all ages	121	5	Another Disney hit	Ginger L
147	March 14, 2013	It was well staged and beutiful. But...Since I had seen the Lion King Disney movie at least 1000 times, I was bored to tears.	71	4	Great, but same old story	Backdoc1
5	March 14, 2013	Just go see it . There is a reason it has had such a long run. THe theatre is beautiful and the production and performances spectacular .	1	5	Brilliant	GettingThere76
103	March 11, 2013	"this is a play to take the family to...but don't cram them full of the video before you do. The puppetry is just stunning. I would recommend for older kids vs the under 5 crowd. I would say this would be best for the 10 and up crowd. The music is good but the ""animals"" are what makes this a truly stunning play. definitely a treat."	55	4	Puppetry is worth the price of admission - try to get an aisle seat	frequentTraveler1801
20	March 11, 2013	A great and moving show. I sat in the orchestra seats i must say they are the best seats. I cant say much about this show dont want to give any suprises away. But heres a tip get orchestra seats you will be surprises especially if your in an aisle seat. This show is great for Disney fans and just broadway fans alike no wonder this show has a long run and it will keep going too. Tickets are expensive but well worth the money. I assure you will go into the show with a smile and leave with a smile!	16	5	A New York Landmark Broadway Show	scorpionking14
46	March 13, 2013	This is the best I have ever seen on Broadway. Everything about the show is amazing. The set is gorgeous, the costumes are imaginative and beautiful, the acting is quality, the music is perfect, and the adaptation from the classic to the stage was flawless. I cannot think of one bad thing to say about this one. It may be a bit too scary for small children at some parts but I think most are fine. If you only have time to see one play it is definitely this one.	25	5	Best of Broadway	LeeLafferty
116	March 14, 2013	Loved the show, the costumes, performers and sets were unbelievable!!! Had great seats in the Mezzanie front row, center. The theatre was a little cold, wore my coat the whole time.	45	5	Matinee	harleyfran
2	March 5, 2013	The music, the stage, the costumes and the voices were absolutely faultless. If you closed your eyes you could almost be watching the film - the really bring it alive. Don't come to NYC and not see this show, it is a must!	2	5	Lion King - a sensational evening	Morgan2080
42	March 6, 2013	I have wanted to see Lion King on Broadway for years- it was worth the wait. The family enjoyed the whole performance- very entertaining. Expensive but went for a special occasion celebration - so we splurged.	16	5	Great performance!	sharonjean872
73	March 7, 2013	I went to see the lion king with my boyfriend who had never seen and movie. I am a huge Disney fan, so needless to say, I love it and he did too! The costumes, music, everything was spectacular. If you are taking your kids, or you are a big kid, sit on or near the aisle as the characters walk down to the stage.	24	5	Even non-Disney fans will Love this!	IslandGirl_345
81	March 9, 2013	Seen this play twice, makes for a great date, but its pricey as tickets run around $150 a piece, and higher of course. I was never really into watching plays till I saw this as my first play on Broadway. This show you can tell is totally professional, as I promise you will get what you pay for, or I would not have went a second time to see it. I will say it again, you get what you pay for. Don't forget to put this on your list of things to see in the Theater district. Right in the heart of Time Square.	45	5	Great Date!	FreeM357
528	April 29, 2013	I loved the movie and the play was spectacular. I loved the opening singing it was so powerful. It was a well done production.	131	5	Loved It	Wandering_Freee
9	May 3, 2013	We saw this production on a Thursday night and were blown away by it. The set and costume deign are phenomenal, the actors were great and the choreography was superb.  My only complaint were the people sitting around us, talking to one another and texting on their cell phones - an unwelcome distraction. Perhaps rules of theatre etiquette needs to be reiterated at the beginning of the performance.	3	5	Incredible	zararm
8	May 6, 2013	The whole family were enthralled by this show. We chose it as we knew it would appeal to all ages and were not disappointed.  We had great seats, middle of the front row of the mezzanine. They supplied a cushion for out daughter so she could see over the bar.	2	5	It was to die for!	NathanKaa
4	May 10, 2013	The part I liked the most, the opening, was grandiose. I really enjoyed the fact that the troup exploited the whole room, and seeing the elephants and other characters come from the audience was very nice. The show itself was good, but I didn't care that much about it. The costumes are very nice, though, and I've enjoyed the choreographs quite a lot. Overall enjoyable but I wouldn't go back...	2	4	Amazing Opening!	FRS781
13	May 14, 2013	I loved this musical! the characters and the way they bring animals to live, the music, the way they changed sets... everything was just amazing! I recommend the mezzanine sits. We sat in the second row and had an excellent view (and these aren't the most expensive tickets). 	7	5	AMAZING!!	Joana L
7	May 21, 2013	There are few bad seats so if ou are worried about not getting a good seat...well, don't worry...We loved, loved, loved it! I took my daughter and through teary eyes, I looked over to see my daughter tearing up! It was AMAZING!!!	2	5	The Incredibly Awesome Lion King	Paula K
16	May 23, 2013	Worth every penny! Simply an amazing production. Brings back great memories of the movies. A must see if you are in NYC!	5	5	Incredible, Must See!	Kareem S
138	May 28, 2013	We were looking for a show on Broadway and so many people recommended us the Lion King. We tried to get some reduced tickets, because they cost over £100 each person.  We didn't in the end, but it was well worth every penny we paid for it.  The whole show, actors, costumes, dances, singing....very professional Would see it again	38	5	Fantastic show on Broadway	Jenbri63
38	May 29, 2013	Well if its been the highest grossing Broadway Musical of all time.... that kinda says it all doesn't it!! Treat yourself to a cocktail from the bar before the show.	12	5	Check out the Hyenas!!	EleanorDesmond
42	May 31, 2013	Enjoyable show but have seen better. Costumes were fantastic and music was wonderful. Thought the voices of some (definitely not all) of the main characters let the show down slightly. Having said all of the above still worth seeing while staying on Broadway. 	28	4	Worth Seeing	Michelle W
150	June 3, 2013	What amazed me most was the way the animation was transferred to live stage. The choreography and costumes were fantastic. The music very good. The voices were fine, and the overall staging just magnificent. If you like The Lion King movie, then this is a must-see. 	287	5	Magnificent transformation.	SoBeSparky
19	June 7, 2013	Costumes and music were amazing. Prices are very expensive but worth it. My daughter left her phone there and the guard went in after hours and found it for us. 	7	5	Lion king with Teenagers.	Jschuller
3	June 12, 2013	This show makes you cry and gives you goose bumps and make you feel happy to be a human being. GO SEE IT! (and take your kids)	2	5	Could Be the Best On Bway!	AllieFarina
14	June 15, 2013	Loved everything about it! The costumes where amazing and the cast was so wonderful to listen to. The children that played Simba and Nala did an amazing job	9	5	Best Show Ever!	Kathryn B
92	June 18, 2013	The costuming is breath taking. I have seen this show 4 times now and each time is better. If you go, I recommend aisle seats in the Orchestra section as the characters utalize the aisles during the performance	37	5	SPECTACULAR	julemag
7	June 22, 2013	I really liked this show. A friend of mine chose it and I was a little bit skeptical because I would have rather gone seeing something else, but the show was great. I had really a good time and the actors, especially the really young one were incredible. I would definitely watch it again.	1	5	Great first Broadway show	LuluCentro
13	June 24, 2013	The show was great. The actors were very professional and very committed with their character. Very different than what you would see at Disney. Loved it and recommend it.	5	5	Not just for kids	walnutlobe
31	June 25, 2013	Every time in New York we see musicals and The Lion King never got my attention (is something for kids) but no, is so well make, even if you know the hole story you will enjoy and wanted to see it again! 	29	5	It is for every one.	Fioriypom
50	June 25, 2013	This is a must see show when visiting New York, Its so beautiful, and its fun, not only for kids in my point of view. Its a great show, music is great!	21	5	The most beautiful broadway show	Sandrihabrasil
124	June 25, 2013	Saw this show with family from 5 to 50 years old. Everyone enjoyed the costumes, singing and story. If you are looking for a show that is appropriate for young children but will not bore adults, this is it.	82	4	Something for Everyone	ligligmv
75	June 26, 2013	This is my 2nd time seeing the show. I took my baby for her 12th birthday! So enjoyable as always. So exciting. Gotta love Timone.	59	5	What's not to love?	Amy5f
62	June 22, 2013	Well worth seeing. We had seats in the fourth row from the front, but most seats had great views. This production was much better than the version we saw in Sydney years ago and I would thoroughly recommend seeing it. 	35	5	Brilliant show	Lismaur
65	June 23, 2013	What can I say about the Lion King. Just incredible. The costumes, the music, the cast, all fabulous! Expensive tickets but worth it!	26	5	Incredible!	MelG78
165	June 23, 2013	Excellent show..loved it. I really enjoyed the show, specially the costumes. They were so creative and colorful. Perfect for kids! A must see.	72	5	Excellent show	Shrutikapoor
64	June 24, 2013	A long time fan of musicals, I finally decided it was time to see the much raved about Lion King. We got the premium seats to be close and center. The costumes were amazing. Songs - OK Story - well know Worth Seeing - Yes Top ten musicals I have seen - No	15	4	Not your typical musical	384JohnC
43	June 19, 2013	Really enjoyed the show. Not a bad seat in the house. If you want to treat yourself, this is a great way to spend the evening in NYC	30	5	Mesmerizing	deb2427
67	June 20, 2013	It's the Lion King - what's not to like? The singers/actors were absolutely incredible! The theater was beautiful	17	4	Great family friendly production	kdmc0408
12	June 20, 2013	I've seen this twice- once in high school in 1999... and then again in Spring of 2012. Both times were amazing. Every seat is a good one in this theater as well. When you are in the balcony, you get the full effect of the first scene with the march to Pride Rock. But from the orchestra, you feel like you are right in the midst of it. People of all ages will enjoy although some scenes might be scary for younger kids. I think the age limit might be 7. Great family show!	3	5	Lion King	Kikumpops
4	June 21, 2013	This production is a must see if visiting NYC. The Lion King was very entertaining. I was afraid that my 10 year old would fall asleep but he was wide awake and was clapping more than I was!	81	5	Love it!	LeiQue
78	June 15, 2013	I'd give it an excellent of it wasn't so expensive. The play is visually stunning and offers a lot of entertainment. Story is old and over told but the sets and costumes keep your attention. If you have kids, they will love it. 	37	4	Visually stunning	thinairman
6	June 15, 2013	"My husband and I had seen Lion King a number of years ago. We had front, center, orchestra seats. The colors, costumes, cast and especially the ""puppets"" were beautiful and joyous. However somewhere toward the middle of the play we became a little bored. The second time my husband had business meetings so my 10 year old grandson and I were on our own. This time our seats were in the center of the next to last row in the mezzanine. What a difference the seats made. We could see the entire stage and all the action all the time. It made the show more exciting. If Lion King is THE SHOW you want to see, I agree with Steph C's suggestion that tickets be bought before you arrive in NY. Every seat was filled. Lots of kids some as young as 3. It was a great audience and that added to the excitement and magic ."	1	4	better the second time around	sdf429
14	June 17, 2013	"The theater is dangerous. Only disney could have gotten a permit for rows that long without an isle break, add to that the single means of egress and I would not return to the ""Minskoff theater"" for any performance. This is a disney space built inside a hotel, not a Broadway Theater. The costumes are gorgeous and they make the choreography look great, but this is still nothing but a disney review, a la disney land, on Broadway, go for free when you're at a disney property. In New York spend your money on real theater."	8	2	Go to a real Broadway show	Villager421523
14	June 18, 2013	Fantastic!!!! Very worthwhile, specially at the front row seats!!! The experience was very impressive!	9	5	Lion King!	Evaldo_Brazil
29	June 12, 2013	Cant say enough about this production, it appeals to adults, teens and kids alike..Never seen so many wide eyed children! Wonderful experience!	28	5	Wonderful Family Entertainment!	FloridaBeachfamily
31	June 13, 2013	the lion king great show the production is fantastic everything is just impressive the cast is great be aware that the show is 3 hours long but you wont regret it its worth every second. take your kids believe me they will love live theater after this.	35	5	best show on broadway	Greypam

9	June 14, 2013	My first show on Broadway - and it was everything I had hoped and more. It is like watching the movie - only better. I can't believe how they got the characters to come to life they way they did. The costumes were so creative and colorful. And they managed to make the large, complicated scenes look believable on stage. I want to go back and see it again.	3	5	Incredible show	Tone84
9	June 7, 2013	Fantastic show and not just for kids! In our opinion the best on broadway, loved it! This is the 3rd time we have seen and it never loses its magic	3	5	Best show!	Ali_GatorLondon
46	June 8, 2013	We were lucky enough to line up for reduced tickets and got seats in the 4th row. Probably one of the best shows we have seen and so happy we saw it on Broadway	25	5	Fantastic show	Diane D
47	June 10, 2013	It's fabulous. Everything you heard is true. Opening number is the best part, but the whole show is wonderful. 	18	5	Do you really need me to tell you it's fabulous?	Risa S
484	June 11, 2013	From the moment of the opening where you see the animal costumes and special effects for the first time, until the end, you are continuously enthralled and amazed by the costumes and how they work to become live animals. The music, song and story were know and delivered but it was the working costumes that blew us all away. Must see.	185	5	Astonishing fun for all ages	Brad M
18	June 4, 2013	I’ll begin with the good: a spectacular opening number that literally caused me to tear up; gorgeous and creatively designed costumes and puppets; an innovative approach to a classic Disney tale; and a truly wonderful performance by the actor who played Rafiki.  However, after reading all of the glowing, hyped reviews for this musical and building up considerable anticipation, both my husband and I walked away underwhelmed. Aside from Rafiki, the singing and acting were just okay, the sets fairly basic and less than eye-popping, and the dance routines were about polished as an average community theatre number.  All in all, we enjoyed a really fun, colorful evening and had a great time reliving some childhood memories, but for nearly $200 a ticket, I suppose I expected to be blown out of the water with full scale musical bliss. We saw a small production of Guys and Dolls in Canada earlier in the week and paid a tenth of the price for just as much talent and enjoyment. I’d recommend Lion King for those who could secure a discounted ticket or for those with young children. Otherwise…try Phantom, Chicago, or one of the other more grandiose performances.	10	3	Fun, Flamboyant...but a notch below Fabulous	HummingbirdSpirit1
135	June 5, 2013	This was our first Broadway show experience, and it was amazing! We had our 12 and 7 year-old girls with us and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. The costumes, the sets, the music - it was all fantastic! I balked at going to the show because of the cost of the tickets, but in the end, I was very glad we did it. Well worth the money to see such a great production.	59	5	An Amazing Show!	KAHLJH
192	June 5, 2013	Never get tired of it. Its a masterpiece everyone needs to watch on Broadway! Truly a treat for the senses - for kids and adults alike. Its been running at the Minskoff for over a decade and still continues to pack houses!	222	5	A classic	Jubin E
240	June 7, 2013	I see 20 Broadway shows/year and had never been to The Lion King. I never saw the point of going to a live performance of a cartoon. Now I know why I was avoiding it. The costumes and puppets are outstanding. Unfortunately, that's all there is to this show. The performances are mediocre and it is overly long due to numerous, pointless dance sequences. If you have small children, they may enjoy the costumes and won't realize the performers are just average, so they might enjoy it. The theater is huge and brand new, so the seating is more comfortable than most on Broadway, but the show itself, just average.	158	3	Great Costumes and Puppets, Little Else	Elman1952
26	May 31, 2013	I've seen the Lion King three times in London, and so, when I had to organize a group trip to NYC, it seemed like a safe choice for a Broadway show. We purchased our tickets through the group ticket office, which was not as professional or as well organized as their UK counterparts. We were given 15 seats in the very last row of the upper balcony at $90 each. (6 of the tickets I donated to Most Valuable Kids NYC, a very worthy organization). I was afraid that we wouldn't have a good view of the stage, but the Minskoff theater is not large, and even the smallest in our group had no problems seeing the stage. I was disappointed in the show. The stage was smaller and the production values lower than in London despite the tickets for the lowest category costing over twice as much. I wouldn't recommend this show for anyone able to see it in the UK or Germany. The snacks are way overpriced ($6 for soft drink/ $4 for water). Since bags are searched and food/drinks taken away, bring an empty bottle and a packet of Crystal light and mix your own drink from the water fountains.	18	3	Not impressed	GermanMum
25	June 2, 2013	We booked tickets 2 months in advance and chose to be on the very back row of the mezzanine - we still had a wonderful view. The show was fab!	10	5	Great Show	kazclo
7	June 2, 2013	"This is a must-see musical for all ages. It is truly a phenominal musical from the first note to the last. The sets and costumes are phenominal. As are the amazing animal puppets.  We sat on the first row and could see every facial expression and enjoy every intricacy of the costumes and the puppets.  When Rafiki hits the first note of ""Circle of Life"" and the African sun begins to rise, all of the animals parade in through the audience down the aisles and it is absolutely breathtaking!  When you sit in the first few rows of the orchestra, your view will be obscurred for the stampede scene. Images are projected on the stage to simulate the stampede and from the first few rows you cannot see the stage floor. For me, it was worth the trade off to have such an amazing view from the front row. There are several new musical numbers that are not in the Disney movie that are outstanding.  The Lion King is pure joy and a must- see. I have seen it several times and I enjoy it more each time. "	6	5	Best Musical Ever	Googa66
145	June 2, 2013	The production of this was incredible. I expected nothing less from a Disney production. The music and vocal performances were awesome. I do have to comment on the staff at the theatre. They were the rudest staff at any venue in the entire city that I came across. To give you an idea of how many venues I came across, I attended 3 Broadway performances and completed 20+ other tours. These were the worst staff. Several that I came into contact with were flat out rude.	75	4	First Class Production. Staff of theatre had no class.	bsilly
46	May 30, 2013	I was absolutely overwhelmed and awestruck with the awesomeness of the production. Loved it loved it loved it. It was pretty pricey, but worth every single penny. The bad parts were: The cost of the tickets, the cost of the concessions (ridiculous) and I couldn't take pictures (I tried to sneak, but came pretty close to being caught.)	16	5	Swept off of my feet! Awestruck! Overwhelmed with Awesomeness!	lovetotravel293
7	May 30, 2013	The music and costuming were wonderful! The seats on the left side cut off part of the stage and parts were hard to see. Advance tickets were pricey	4	4	Great costumes	pbneufeld
42	May 31, 2013	The characters were colorful and the costumes creative, but he stage was too small. It was not grandiose, as I had expected... I enjoyed the movie more.	40	3	Dissapointed	cescolar
66	May 31, 2013	Together with the whole family it was a wonderful experience to see not just the movie before but the show as well, it was a different feeling. My granddaughter really enjoyed and clapped her hands with glee. I myself was mesmerized with the superb performances, the dancers, the singers, the sounds and the lights, the changing of the props (so precise), were really really good! You can see the show again and again, and you will never get bored!	65	5	Great show!	Ester J
102	May 28, 2013	I rated this show as average, since the visuals are very nice, but I found it a little sleepy sometimes. There are segments in which there's too much talk and one tends to fall asleep. Therefore, I'd have appreciated it more if one could see more action from the show. The storyline is very faithful to the original Disney movie. Fans will like it a lot.	56	3	Nice Visuals but a little sleepy, for the price	Podolano
6	May 28, 2013	If you must see a show in NYC then why not see The Lion King? After all, this classic is not only awesome for kids, but totally enthralling for adults as well! (It is Broadway after all!) I've seen dozens of shows on Broadway and this is definitely a favorite. Enjoy!	5	5	A must see on Broadway!	TravelingTingle
39	May 28, 2013	Broadway theatre is always something to be enjoyed. This was certainly true of this production, EXCEPT that we had dreadful seats way off to the left of the stage. Our view of some of the production was severely limited which is really disappointing given the cost of the tickets. Notwithstanding that the production is very good even if I felt that some of the performers were just doing their jobs. The standout performer for me was the actor who played Scar. Absolutely superb and I was puzzled as to why his applause was significantly less than that of some of the other performers. Oh well. If you are buying or collecting tickets from the box office allow a bit of time no matter what day of the week. There are always queues.	9	4	Competent production	isiscatnz
10	May 29, 2013	You are never too old or too young to enjoy the production.... it was simply amazing. Try and get seats along the aisle.	4	5	Magical	GinaB88
13	May 25, 2013	The play and actors were fantastic however I was amused that they serve beer from plastic children's cups but when I got a child's drink it came in a bottle.... Staff could be friendlier and more informative. This is a gear experience that should not be missed!	3	4	Love the lion king!!	Angela4717
14	May 27, 2013	We bought premium tickets as we were on our honeymoon but were thrilled with the seats close to the stage as the show was amazing! The transformation into the animals was impressive and the performance was fantastic. The buzz afterwards made us want to go see another broadway show on our trip but we didn't have time :(	7	5	Amazing!	holidayreviewer84
186	May 27, 2013	The puppeteers are amazing making the animals in this play so realistic! The voices on the characters are amazingly clear and so great. The drummers playing the bongos were very entertaining to watch. We were mesmerized by the acting and the music! Like all of Disney, it is truly MAGICAL!!!	67	5	Expensive, but so worth it!	patteo
14	May 28, 2013	Great Location on Time Square, easy booking and ticket collection. Good Show and very clear view. Merchandise not too expensive and quick service. Bar facilities poor, huge queues and lots of queue jumping as servers didn't take notice of who was next and there weren't clearly defined lines.	2	4	Lion King	JanJamKat
121	May 22, 2013	Never ever been to a live show like this before and loved every minute of it. It was very entertaining and kept us amazed throughout all of the show. I enjoyed it that much in NYC i have bought tickets for my wife and i to see the show here in Australia. You would be crazy not to do this broadway show while you are in NYC.	52	5	Wow.....What a show!!!!	jason d
22	May 23, 2013	Fantastic production unlike anything I've ever seen. My 8 and 5 year old loved it! Don't fret taking your child if they're over 3-4 years old. Masterful!	4	5	Yeah, it's all that!	RovingSouls
76	May 23, 2013	Excellent show for all ages. It thrills the young and old alike and it offers valuable life lessons.	24	5	Saw this 3 x	Gourmand101
110	May 23, 2013	It is so easy to understand why Lion King is a long time Broadway favorite. The costumes, the set, the colors, the talent...all come together to produce an outstanding musical.	32	5	Favorite of granddaughters	FlamFlomingo

It was amazing!	8	5	Amazing!	nathdunf

13	May 7, 2013	We took the whole family to see The Lion King on Broadway. All my children were completely captivated, especially the younger ones. The singing and dancing were superb! We sat in the very back row in the top balcony and saw everything perfectly. Well done!	1	5	AMAZING!	BigRedFam6

71	May 4, 2013	It was a great show and love the Minskoff Theatre. Don't think this is a kids show coz it aint. Worth the money and time you will invest in the tickets.	32	5	GREAT	sissy7500
11	May 5, 2013	The lion king was funny and cute for the kids. I am 9 and loved it. If you want to show your kids a great show you should take them to the lion king.	9	4	Great show	freddydr

31	April 29, 2013	I personally am not a fan of musicals but whilst in NYC my wife persuaded me to go to a show on broadway and i loved every moment of this amazing show. If you have seen the disney film which i am sure most of you have this is such a great story and follows the film very closely and is great fun fir all ages.	16	5	This is a must.	vass6283
77	May 1, 2013	I am not really a musical fan. So my opinion here should not count much. But may be this musical is a muss do in NYC. If you are not the musical typ I would not go.	17	3	very interesting	Andre_Sereno
43	May 2, 2013	Really impressed with costumes to portray the various animals. Music was awesome. We sat in the last row of the balcony and it far exceeded our expectations. The sound and view were awesome from there. Certainly gave us the sense that there is no poor seat in the house.	23	5	Great Broadway Show	Bruce W
60	May 2, 2013	What an amazing time!! Okay, my parents were suprising me with an evening at the Minskoff Theatre to watch the show, which i was very unaware of.  So when I found out I was very excited. My brother on the other hand (14) was not so happy about it. He thought it was going to be too much for kids and too boring for him. The show began and as soon as the first scene started my brother was so into it! More than i was I believe. So that just shows you this is for anyone! It was a great show and I can't wait to go back and see it again.	33	5	Amazing perfection	MeGabriela
32	June 26, 2013	My husband and I saw this play in February. We had 2 for 1 tickets. I have wanted to see this play for years and it was worth the wait! We had aisle seats in the orchestra which was great because the giant animal figures came down the aisle right next to us! 	48	5	Great play! A Must See!	snoopy1128
4	June 29, 2013	"Attended on Tuesday the 25th June. For 157 dollars a ticket with seats that were ""average"" we found this show over rated. I guess we had very high expections and was looking forward to seeing a broadway musical for a long time. The actor rifiki and scar made the show alot better as they put in a great effort. We just felt that some of the cast was doing a very mediocre job and had no heart in the performance, especially the hyenas. We were looking for that emotional heart feeling and didny get it. We had just come from Disneyworld and the finding nemo musical was a whole lot better"	3	3	Overated	Craig S
6	July 2, 2013	Perfect end to a wonderful trip! It was expensive (as all Broadway shows are), but well worth it. I don't think we'd go again. More of a one time thing. Wouldn't have missed it though!	7	5	Wonderful!	Crystal8j
69	July 4, 2013	This was an amazing show. I was originally concerned because I was use to the animated film so I was not sure how the story would transform from big screen to stage. However, one of the best broadway shows I have ever seen!!! Take the entire family. 	62	5	Wonderful!	Rubigirl13
37	July 8, 2013	The performers were excellent, young and old. The props and  costumes were brilliant. The only warning I could offer to future audience is to make sure you take a jacket. I went with my two  adult daughter and we were in the second row and we froze through the whole performance. One of my daughters was so cold she put a map over her to try and cover up.	22	4	Amazing Performance	Jennifer S
34	July 10, 2013	Do not miss this. I have seen it more than once. I took my niece the first time. The music is great, and the costumes are more than you can even imagine	12	5	WOW	CAgirl408
2	July 15, 2013	The Lion King Musical show is one of the most important and popular theater event ever produced by Broadway in the theater world. It takes an inspiration from the old-age Lion King cartoon, in which a young Lion loses its father Lion in the Jungle fight. The show makes the whole story interesting with a background music from the ages. The Lion King Musical is a must watch Musical theater. You can attend the Lion King musical event with buying tickets online. I bought discounted tickets online from http://www.askaticket.com/theatre/the-lion-king-tickets/. It was great experience. Must not miss if you are in NY.	1	5	The Lion King; one of the biggest and successful musical theatre	Jennifereve110
173	July 17, 2013	I've been wanting to see this for years. My husband finally bought us tickets. We had seats in the Mezz row A seats 120/121. These are good seats right in the center with no rows in front of you.  I'm still in awe over this performance. What a beautiful production. The actors were just excellent! The way they made themselves into the animals were just incredible and amazing. The theater has great sound and didn't feel stuffy except for the seats seemed narrow.  I wish broadway show tickets weren't so costly. ($171 each) otherwise I'd be seeing this one over and over. Just loved it! So worth seeing if you haven't seen it already. 	88	5	Just awesome	sarasmom
49	July 21, 2013	Wow. Wow. Wow. Impressive from every conceivable angle. Great show for kids and adults. There was a slight noise issue with a speaker at one point but the show must go on and it did without a hitch or a missed beat by the actors. 	20	5	Wow!	PinkParabola
46	July 25, 2013	Such a beautiful production! The acting, the costumes, the set designs are truly breathtaking! a MUST see!	18	5	Go, go go!	chefmelmartinez
255	July 29, 2013	I don't think anyone can visit New York without taking in a show, and The Lion King was our first choice! We enjoyed it tremendously. It is so difficult to explain to others exactly how the costuming works, but it is a marvel all in itself. I will never forget the final standing ovation; the woman who played the grown-up Nala and boy who played the young Simba were positively glowing! My only regret was not purchasing any souvenirs there; I thought the Disney store would carry some Lion King merchandise, but that was pretty much limited to a Simba stuffed animal.	89	5	A Must See for All Ages	Lynne0725
47	July 30, 2013	Great seats, great talents, costumes and scenery and music were wonderful. Very expensive. The only negative was the kid who continually kicked the back of my seat.	8	5	Excellent!	aspen1961
7	August 3, 2013	Very good show. The costumes were amazing. The music was nice and an amazing cast. The set was colorful with a lot of changes. This was unbelievable. 	5	5	What can I say.	TraceyRichardson
21	August 6, 2013	It's the next best thing after the Disney movie and it as some great voices in the play. It is still capable of surprising the audience	5	5	Great show	PatriciaTRusso

219	August 14, 2013	Not being a theater buff I can only say that our group of 4 enjoyed the performance. We were amazed by the costumes, stage settings and effects and of course the standard of acting from the cast. The only criticism was that the start of the performance was late, not necessary when the audience was kept waiting outside long after the doors open time.	100	5	Amazing	Jon068
84	August 17, 2013	Really nice play, although more expensive than other. However, it is worth the price for the performance.	34	5	It deserves its success	lfbitt

99	August 18, 2013	"Okay, Ladies, do you have trouble getting Pop to Broadway? Our NYC ""home"" is 30 blocks away from this big attraction on Broadway and Wiffie has been trying to get me here for years. Well, yesterday I caved. It was a stunning day in NYC and we took a long walk to 45th Street, went up to the box office about noon and, sure enough, there were seats left to buy (some get tickets months and months in advance on Broadway, but our experience has been that tickets can be had for afternoon shows Saturdays and Sundays by walk-ups). Paid $99 each for two ducats, exact center, Row Z. People a short distance up front with the same view paid $189.  Anyway, I'm an old geezer with long legs and the point of this review is to encourage your reluctant young or old geezer with this as an impromptu weekend thing to do. This is one of the few theaters on Broadway that is actually comfortable for long-legs (sort of like Premium Economy) on a flight, and the show is totally engaging."	47	4	For Ladies With Reluctant Hubbies....

43	August 14, 2013	We love it. Colorful, vibrant, energetic ... amazing story that they told brilliantly. Worth the money -- and appropriate for all ages. 	15	4	FANTASTIC SHOW!!	P E
33	August 15, 2013	Fantastic show, wonderful acting and singing, ingenious costume design and a real feel good factor throughout. The only disappointment was the performer playing 'older' Simba was very unconvincing, he had a very feminine voice as well as a lisp while speaking, which was generally fine, except when he was attempting powerful speeches and trying to sound strong. Aside from this very minor downside it is very worthwhile seeing-kids and adults equally enjoy it.	45	4	Hear the roar!!	mikekwd
163	August 15, 2013	The show itself was great. Wonderful costumes, music, and great performances. I especially loved the character playing the bird that was Mufasa's 'assistant'. However, and through no fault of the show or the theater, we sat in front of a woman with four small children, two of which NEVER stopped talking LOUDLY throughout the show. She would toss an occasional 'SHH' at them, but overall she really didn't care. I don't know whether I should just expect that during an afternoon matinee and know better, or whether to think it's just another example of parents who have no control over their children. I think the latter, because there were several other family's sitting near us with small children who were very well behaved and quiet. It's really a shame too, because it really impacted our enjoyment of what was really a great show. I would recommend going to a night show and hoping there are less children, or at least hoping the children who do attend are well behaved for what is supposed to be a show for all to enjoy.	88	4	Don't do the matinee	launcher69
19	August 12, 2013	The Lion King is spellbinding. From the music to the incredible costumes this is a not to miss show. The story never gets old and it is done in such a beautiful way that I had tears streaming down my cheeks at the end.	5	5	Incredible in every way!	rnich
27	August 15, 2013	We were overwhelmed by the fabulous costumes and creativity of the producers. The level of detail used in the execution was perfect. One of the rare things deserving 5 stars!	20	5	Amazing - best musical ever	Daan636
6	August 12, 2013	We enjoyed The Lion King very much, but we expected more since we were seeing this one on Broadway. There were a couple of understudies performing; maybe that was the reason it was a little less impressive than when we saw it in Chicago.	2	4	Not as good as Chicago production	Dave L
7	August 13, 2013	If you can only see one show, this is it! Try to get aisle seats in orchestra as performers will use the aisles. 	2	5	Excellent, all the kids want to see again!	WhatWeThought2013
9	August 13, 2013	Amazingly done! Kept to the story line, the dancing, the imagery was just wonderful. I recommend this show to everyone even if you're not into Disney movies it really is a beautifully done show.	7	5	Loved it!	Neesh33
8	August 8, 2013	Beatiful costumes, great show and music. If you can, try to get seats on the aisle for a great view. really enjoyed and did not see the time pass.	4	5	Great Great Show	Janie M
139	August 8, 2013	Booked tickets on Viator.com and picked them up at the box office. Glad I did since it was a full house every night for the next week! We had excellent seats in the stalls, row U? Amazing production.	77	5	Fantastic show	budge185
46	August 9, 2013	What can I say, other than if you haven't seen this show go see it its worth every penny. The costumes, make up, musical score are just amazing!!	33	5	Brilliant!!	hayl341
31	August 12, 2013	OK, disclaimer - I'm no expert on musicals, but the two I've seen in the theatre and the several more on TV didn't really set me on fire. So when we were bought tickets to The Lion King as a honeymoon gift I thought OK, let's go along and see what the fuss is about. And I have to say, I absolutely loved every minute. The company makes good use of the 1700 seater Minskoff theatre and certainly makes you feel as if you're right in the action. All the songs from the film are there, plus several new ones - and the cast were very good (especially Rafiki). The quality of singing and stagework was brilliant, even for a misery guts like me. So if I had a great time, it must be good. Go and see it if you're there. Highly recommended.	8	5	Don't like musicals, but I loved this	Odavy
54	August 4, 2013	"Lovely costumes, sets, music....makes it a fun filled ""must do"" in NYC. The actors did a great job including the child artists. "	26	5	Excellent show for entire family	MumbaiKss
113	August 4, 2013	I took my 9 year old daughter to see this show - her very first one on Broadway - and she thoroughly enjoyed it (as did we!). The costumes are so clever and creative. Powerful singing. Very well done!	32	5	Great show for kids and their parents	saavychic
11	August 4, 2013	There isn't one thing I didn't like the about this show. The plot was cohesive and very easy to follow. The music was outstanding. The talent of all the actors was amazing. There was alway something going on whether in front of us, behind us, or atop of us. Would go watch this again!	3	5	One of the best shows I've seen	Nicole L
134	August 5, 2013	Great music and amazing costumes, which are just as amazing no matter how many times you have seen this show. Rafiki and Zasu's puppeteer stole the show. Very fun.	42	4	Good show.	cherylburnside
12	July 31, 2013	Fantastic production. KIds absolutely loved it and it was one of the best Broadway shows I have ever seen.	2	5	Must See	rcaron66
122	August 1, 2013	I have seen many Broadway shows in NYC but The Lion King is by far the best!! My husband and I had seen it many years ago but once we had our children we couldn't wait to take them to see it. The costumes, music and choreography are all outstanding. We bought orchestra seats so that we'd be close up to the action and see the actors up close when they travel through the aisles. I highly recommend buying orchestra seats. You truly feel like you are in the middle of an African jungle. Be a part of the action and buy your seats today!!	98	5	AMAZING PERFORMANCE!	PoshPrincessTravel
54	August 1, 2013	This show was breath taking! Perfect for all ages. The sets and acting were magnificent! I had times were I just couldn't stop smiling. If you're in New York, this is definitely a must see!!	11	5	Amazing!!! A Must See!!	kluthi1934
32	August 2, 2013	What to congratulate on first? Great costumes, great acting, great performance, comfortable place !! Amazing experience!!	15	5	Amazing performance!!	Spirosssssssss
16	July 29, 2013	Great for the whole family. Loved the costumes, amazing use of body extensions in the costumes. The designs of the masks for the main two lions is outright wonderful. The actors are brilliantly put into roles. Highly recommend, even a guy who is not thrilled with theater will like it. 	8	5	A must see!	livinglifetraveling
81	July 29, 2013	Believe it or not this is a fantastic show. We've seen it twice now, once in Vegas and now once on Broadway. At first we wondered how they could make a play form a cartoon, but the costumes are magnificent. The sets, costumes, and topic keeps your attention and it does not feel like it lags. 	44	5	I just can't wait to be King	travelin4funfools
30	July 29, 2013	So, I booked tickets to this show for my wife on our 10 year anniversary. I was not excited in the least about attending a Broadway show, but again, it was not for me, this was for her. We sat about 15 rows back in the center. Again, this is not my type of thing, but the show was actually very entertaining. The cast in the animal costumes were truly impressive and the way they manipulated the oversized outfits was very extraordinary. The performers, as you would expect, were incredible however my only complaint was the makeup of the performers who manipulated the hand-puppets. They were green and blue, which did not matter, but it was just odd. I had to admit, I enjoyed myself. I would recommend it if you are looking for a Broadway show to attend.	15	4	Not for me, but entertaining	Jay R
4	July 30, 2013	It was my 2nd time seeing The Lion King, I attended the play two years ago with friends. I insisted on bringing my family to see it. It is only getting better to watch! 	119	5	Excellent Show	Jeanette R
53	July 25, 2013	It is expensive but it was brilliant. The singing was fantastic and the costumes were outstanding. Have to buy all drinks inside the theatre. We couldn't buy the tickets anywhere else but the theatre itself, so may as well have ordered them well in advance and got the performance we really wanted to go to.	34	5	Well worth it	happy2travelBelfast
81	July 26, 2013	I think this show is awesome.  And to me the first act is the best!! I was so excited when it all started.  The costumes are incredible and the stage was something I had never had the chance to experience, I was really impressed. Rafiki is the best! Tickets are not cheap but I think is worth it; we had seats on the back of the theater, like 4 rows before the end, right in the middle, and they were great! and this allow you to really appreciate the stage. Arrive early so you can wander around the candy shop and the gift shop and be sure to be at your place when it starts as I think first scene IS THE BEST and should not be missed.	22	5	Great show and worth the price	laurichiz
106	July 27, 2013	Must say I have not seen Lion King for several years but total have seen it 4 times. It is breathtaking. The beginning when the animals walk down to the stage my eyes well up every time. If you have never seen a broadway show don't see Lion King first because once you have seen Lion King all the other Broadway shows are just good and not sensational. Lion King is the very very best.	38	5	The Best	Susie W
9	July 28, 2013	Lion King was an excellent show. The actors and sets were astounding. It was worth every penny to see.	2	5	Fantastic	Anthony S
402	July 22, 2013	Second time I've seen the Lion King and I enjoyed it as much the second time as the first. It is simply a beautiful production. The costumes are phenomenal and the music is just fabulous. It's hard to not feel good after seeing this play. Go with confidence that you will enjoy!	175	5	A Joy!	ljtraveler_11
164	July 23, 2013	I know, I know. It's beloved and has been playing forever. but, after the first few minutes of spectacle with the puppets, you're left with The Lion King. Never been my favorite. I get that I'm in the minority, but I was bored. The Lion King isn't that riveting to me. Maybe it is for you, and I bet you'll like it.	41	2	Not for me	mosthecat
41	July 24, 2013	music and cast are just wonderful , the story it makes you laugh and cry at the same time, my childrens favourite disney movie and the stage version did not disappoint the giraffes and elephants are amazing	22	5	best show on broadway	JCM80
115	July 24, 2013	My 14-year old daughter loves the Lion King movie and can sing the entire sound track from memory. I did not want to see the LK because I would have preferred to see Matilda, Kinky Boots, etc., i.e., something newer (did see Book of Mormon; separate review). Daughter wasn't impressed but wouldn't let me give it less than a 3 (I would give it a 2). I'm sure part of it is that the soundtrack is perfect & stage singing isn't, but that's supposed to be compensated for by the energy of the live performers, costumes, etc. Whole thing seemed dated and frankly I was bored most of the time. Perfect seats, dead center 4th row. Maybe for younger kids???	63	3	"14-year old says it was ""okay"""	NMBomber
58	July 18, 2013	I was a little skeptical whether this was going to be worth the cost - they don't offer any discount tickets at TKTS or elsewhere, so it was definitely on the high side for broadway. But wow, they really did a fantastic job of translating this story to the stage! The costumes and the choreography was great, and they have characters that weave (or sprint!) their way through the theater, which really pulls the audience in (but keep everything out of the aisle - arms, legs, purses!) 	17	5	wonderful show for all ages	jujSF
22	July 18, 2013	A MUST SEE!!!! You need to make sure you get a seat in the middle of the theater, but thats just common sense. 	25	5	Awesome Show!	Luc V
25	July 20, 2013	Saw the show for the second time during our family trip to NYC. It always amazes me how the young kids are so talented and not to mention the costumes are breathtaking! Whether you're a family with young kids, going on a date, or just going by yourself, make sure you see this show if you are planning on seeing something on Broadway! Hakuna Matata!	14	5	One of the best shows on Broadway!	Shelby W
21	July 21, 2013	This was the second time we've seen this on Broadway - fantastic - this is a show to be seen in this smaller more personal theater for the best effects	10	5	Grand old hotel	holidaymakerHale
5	July 15, 2013	This show received an A+ from my famil with 3 teens and a 7 year old. We sat 3 rows from the front and there were a lot of surprises for viewing throughout the show. A must see if you have children with you!	5	5	Very emotional and moving performance	Ashley W
24	July 15, 2013	We were able to purchase tickets at a discount at TKTS thinking the kids will enjoy the show. To our surprise, we enjoyed the show as much as the kids. A wonderful production in a beautiful theater.	3	5	A Pleasant Surprise	Unson R
4	July 16, 2013	Loved the Lion King - the costumes, performers, everything was over-the-top fantastic. Only drawback was the very expensive concessions (which is pretty normal for NY).  Show was incredible - husband enjoyed every bit as much as children (11, 11, 9) did!	1	4	Incredible	Eleanor M
4	July 16, 2013	Most incredible show in New York City. The sound and performance were amazing. There was nothing about the show to dislike. The performers did a breathtaking performance. The tickets were a little pricy. But well worth it...	2	5	Awesome	Glenn P
7	July 11, 2013	Lion King is my favorite musical and I highly recommend watching but I must say that the San Diego production is better. Not only could they make the production bigger but since it is only shown on a limited basis, the quality is much better and very noticeable. I suspect it becomes quite routine in NY where focus is more on quantity than quality. 	4	5	Best Musical	subcoms
7	July 12, 2013	This show goes far and beyond what I expected. The mastery of acting and puppetry are fused into a Broadway show stopper! Pure genius in artistry and story. Disney once again created a classic that can be enjoyed by all. 	9	5	Spectacular Show and Premium Talent	BHNC1
16	July 14, 2013	Didn't know what to expect coming here, but it was awazing! The drinks were very expensive, beware! The only thing that annoyed me was people taking photos in the theatre when they are told so many times by staff not too!!!	7	5	Wonderfull show!	Mailand1
44	July 14, 2013	I've seen The Lion King on stage four times, including once from a private box. The story is uplifting and moving, and the songs are powerful. But the thing that makes The Lion King unique is its staging that incorporate live actors, puppets, mechanical characters, and digital characters. As soon as I hear the opening Zulu call, my eyes start to get misty.	20	5	A must-see	Scott H
45	July 8, 2013	We took our sons age 13 and 11 this past week and enjoyed every minute of this show. The costumes so creative and because the music and storyline were familiar to my kids from seeing the movie, that made it more enjoyable for them. We sat on the main level right hand side on the aisle and it was fun when the animals had the procession right beside us. I hesitated because of the price but I'm glad we had this experience in NYC. It was a memorable night!	18	5	Fun for all ages	BethD_13
3	July 8, 2013	Highly recommend The Lion King to all, a great production that gave us a WOW factor all the way through	3	5	Excellent Show	CStruck711
36	July 9, 2013	costumes, sets, great entertainers & singers. Tells a great story that should recharge all of us to know that if our endeavors are genuine, we will eventually succeed	21	4	most enjoyed by children under 1o	Greg3417
422	July 9, 2013	We have always loved the music but to se the entire show with all the fabulous sets and dances altogether was such a treat! We all left the show smiling and singing!	137	5	Great Broadway show!	Betty L
21	July 4, 2013	I've always wanted to see this show and what a perfect way to see it. The shows was fantastic - I'd definitely recommend booking early as good tickets sell fast and you might miss out.	13	4	Great Show!	Jessica S
23	July 6, 2013	Our 11-year old son was dreading going to the theatre, but was blown away in the first minute and can't stop talking about Lion King. Our 14-year old daughter saw it for the second time and states she would rate it more than a 5 if she could. My husband typically just tolerates the theatre for my benefit, but was very pleased to find he could have his adult beverage in the theatre in a sippy cup. And he enjoyed the show. The costumes are out of this world and the music and actors are great. Don't miss it, especially if you have kids!	25	5	"No ""lion"" - a good time was had by all!"	TravelingTexans_11
6	July 6, 2013	My first musical! It was all nice - the singing, the costumes, music, etc. we were dead tired from a whole day trip but it was still worth it. We purchased ticket late and got the full price ticket with not-so-good-seat in mid-back mezzanine. We still got the full view of everything although not so much of facial expression. 	6	4	Nice one!	Victoria S
3	July 7, 2013	"For so many years, I have heard how great this musical is and how breath-taking the incredible Julie Taymor costumes were (and they were). I'm sure many others have heard such ballyhoo as well. However, after sitting in the Minskoff Theatre for two and half hours I'm woefully unimpressed.  The music of this show is, interesting. Orchestrally, I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of instruments that were being used in the live pit. The voices of the actors playing the characters were splendid as well. However, some songs were incredibly forgettable. Sitting here now only two weeks later I can only recall about seven, most of which were from the film. On the other hand, the costumes of this show were truly stunning and breathtaking. You know what else is breathtaking? Niagara Falls. Does that mean I'm going to sit on a bench nearby and stare for two and a half hours? Jokes aside, Julie Taymor should truly be applauded for her brilliant use of materials, colors, and patterns in this shows costume design. Lion King is a great show, I just could do without the gimmick of walking down the aisle every twenty minutes. There is that great moment where the beautiful elephant puppet enters down the aisle and in that moment of surprise, I felt truly overjoyed. But, when this sort of magical one-time experience happens frequently, it becomes a little unsettling, almost as if, ""Oh look who's coming down the aisle now."" It felt a little bit like I was watching the show in a theme park in Orlando, Florida. Also, am I the only one who thought the show dragged at times? I think that had the material been trimmed slightly, the show would have been much more enjoyable. Would I recommend the show to families? Honestly, not really when you can find superior entertainment at Matilda, Cinderella, or Annie just a couple blocks down the street, and at a cheaper price."	1	2	Eh, I Don't See the Hype	Flounder1989
30	July 2, 2013	I took my niece to see this midweek in March, booked it through my hotel concierge tickets cost $189 each with a face value of $139, giving the ticket agent $100 for nothing. The seats were not even in a good location,I think it was the last row in the dress circle. It was very good & on broadway so I expected to spend more, but not $378 approximate £370 . 	14	4	Expensive but very good	Yvonne L
618	July 2, 2013	I saw this show at the end of year in 2011 on December 29th and it was awesome. I know my review is really late, but just wanted to say I lived in NYC for 4 years and never got an opportunity to see this until I came back 6 years later and it was worth. By far the best play around.	193	5	Lion King	jordansbulls
16	July 3, 2013	Went with my daughter, the dancing was fantastic, singing superb, custums out of this world. Would go back again if I get the chanceto visit New Yorkagain	8	5	Amazing	annerobson
115	July 3, 2013	There's a reason this show is a Legend. It was my first Broadway show, and it did not disappoint. In fact, it exceeded my every expectation. The music was unbelievable! But VISUALLY, this show is among the most amazing things I have ever seen. I can't wait to go back and take my whole family. If you're going to New York (as a tourist) this is a MUST MUST MUST!	56	5	Visually Overwhelming!	TheSaent
31	June 30, 2013	Amazing! They brought so much magic to life. I could see it again and again! The creativity and talent was awesome. It was our favorite show that we saw, truly amazing. 	11	5	WOW!	Marhawk77
38	June 30, 2013	It took my breath away. Thats all I need to say. The Music, the costumes and the performance. It was an enchanted evening	15	5	Amazing	Jess H
105	July 1, 2013	My family and I were blown away by the creativity behind the costumes and bringing the animated film to life. The story and songs are well known, but the creative costumes and sets and the actors who performed as talking animals from the film made this an enjoyable experience. The biggest con for us was the price of our tickets.	31	4	Outstanding costumes	baldguyut
6	July 2, 2013	Wonderful! I loved it so much! The entire atmosphere is incredible, and the show is unbelievable. Don't miss it	76	5	Simply the best of Broadway!	Alvise73
24	June 27, 2013	I really enjoyed this show, costuming and singing was awesome. 2 in our party of 4 went to sleep, so make sure only those who will appreciate it go as its pretty expensive. 	14	5	Great show	Jo W
2	June 28, 2013	So, not really a guy who likes shows however to treat my girl we went to see the Lion King. It blew me away. I thought I would be too old to appreciate it, but I was wrong. A must see!	7	5	My girlfriend made me see it...glad she did!	Sam B
178	June 29, 2013	A very good show, and one my family won't soon forget. My kids are 5 & 8-yrs old and they loved it so much they asked if we could go a second night in a row! If they were reviewing they'd give it 5-stars, but I'm a tough critic. This is I the top 10% of shows I've seen, but not the best. Still great fun!	56	4	What a show!!!! Great fun for the whole family.	garci1r
68	June 29, 2013	Exciting, fast paced, a must see for grownup, and children of all ages. Loved that ushers greet you and escort you to your seats. So civilized, the way theatre used to be. A great experience !	38	5	Fabulous	abitadee
14	August 21, 2013	We loved it, amazing costumes as rumours had it. It is true! Great songs, and an african atmosphere :) Great!	1	5	Wonderful!	Caecilie22
11	August 21, 2013	The Lion King was a well done musical. The actors voices were so close to the Disney movie and well cast. The performer who played Scar did a wonderful job. It does not follow the movie exactly but it was close enough taking into account the creative liberties associated with transforming a movie into a play. The costumes were interesting but distracting sometimes and the stage sometimes felt a bit overcrowded with all the animals the crew was trying to portray. Overall however a positive experience.	4	4	Great Broadway show	Jessica J
19	August 25, 2013	The Lion King is a show for all ages, but is so memorable that it might be best enjoyed at age 10 and up. This is an experience you will want to remember forever! The unique sets and interpretation of animals and scenery are characters unto themselves. The cast is energetic, fully engaged and delightfully talented. The musical director and orchestra are excellent. Its not hard to see why this show is still going strong. I could not have believed how extraordinary it is before seeing it.	7	5	Beautiful, unique and storytelling at its finest	jessiejoy4
28	September 1, 2013	A great show. Fun for the whole family. All seats are great. The management staff was wonderful. They noticed I wore a boot for a broken foot, pulled by out of line and took me to the elevator , ***** 5 starts	9	5	Excellent	mfoster419
15	September 3, 2013	Worth going but so expensive. The props were very cool. It's a new experience as compared to the original Disney movie.	11	5	Great show but a bit expensive	petition2God
42	September 4, 2013	There is no much to say about this show that others haven't said. This is an spectacular show that everybody enjoys. I have been living in NYC for 9 years and it was recently that I went as a graduation gift because the tickets are very expensive and you need to buy them few months in advance for most presentations. It was really beautiful. If you can afford it, go see it!	20	5	Amazing show!	PandPfromNY
6	September 5, 2013	Happy I got to see this show on Broadway - Well done! Highly enjoyable.  Beautifule theater with comfortable seats! Only wish that the vendors selling water that were in the theater had COLD water as opposed to the room temp. water we bought for $7. 	8	4	Lion King on Broadway	DissectingDanny

111	September 16, 2013	Wow, this was spectacular and lived up to all the glowing reviews. The colour, the music, the costumes, the lighting, the engaging story, extremely talented and enthusiastic cast members, combined to make this an outstanding triumph and deserving of the standing ovation. You leave the theatre on a high and a smile on your face. What more can you ask for!	54	5	A lion hearted production.	Reece G

45	September 21, 2013	When planning my first visit to New York City the one 'must do' on my list of things to see and do was to see The Lion King on Broadway and I was certainly not disappointed. The show is spectacular from the beginning to the end. The costumes, singing and lighting are amazing. I was mesmerized by the whole performance. We had seats in the first row on the mezzanine level and they were fantastic, you could see and take in the whole atmosphere of the Minskoff Theatre. I can now tick this item off my bucket list and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to see a show on Broadway!!!	87	5	A must see when you visit New York City	Hawaii6
28	September 24, 2013	What a blast- joyful from beginning to end.Catchy tunes, incredible sets, talented artists. An unforgettable performance.	45	5	DO NOT MISS THIS SHOW!	Ozzinow
223	September 27, 2013	"Show is full of colour, great music and a general ""feel good"" atmosphere. Great for the family and anyone who wants a great night out. Theatre is great and far superior in design and layout to most London theatres. Times Square(Its location) is vibrant especially at night. Take a tissue."	117	5	A fantastic, all round good show for anyone	TGG84
13	September 30, 2013	All the production is really awesome! As expected from a giant like broadway! I just loved Rafiki, Mufasa and the kids. They were amazing.It is worth watching this classic 	1	4	Very Good	Vivian A

297	October 8, 2013	We saw The Lion King at the Minskoff Theatre during our honeymoon in NY. Really a great show, wonderful costumes and musics. We were seated in the mezanine with a great view to the stage!	113	5	Great performance!	Luigi D
11	October 3, 2013	I was afraid that the play would not live up to its hype. Boy, was I wrong. There was so much energy and the staging was phenominal. Only complaint was that the theater staff allowed so many folks to come and go during the scenes which was very distracting.	16	5	A Must for Everyone	Azadventurers
29	October 3, 2013	The sets, costumes and choreography are stunning, and there is some memorable music....the script and story development are second rate. Once you've seen the spectacle, you've seen the show.	37	3	Great production, decent score, mediocre book	sftravelholic
184	October 4, 2013	Wonderful show! Amazing costumes, great music; just a joy to see!  For a thrill, get a seat on the isle, the actors use the isles, so an isle seat puts you right in the middle of the action! 	75	5	One of the best shows for young and old alike	LastSecondTraveller
55	October 4, 2013	It was a great play, great music, great costumes. Highly recommend this. We could not find discount tickets but it was worth the price!	9	5	Lion King	jseash
8	October 1, 2013	I had been wanting to see this particular show for such a long time and since we were on Broadway, I had the perfect excuse! An absolutely fabulous performance with superb actors and pitch perfect singing. If you're a fan of the film you will love this rendition as it follows the script nearly word for word and even the voices sound the same! The puppets are incredibly clever and it's just such a fantastic way to portray the story. Now when it came to seating I did an awful lot of research and settled on the Mezzanine seats 131&132 which were on the front row. We had a fantastic birds-eye view from here as we could see the entire stage and capture every bit of what was going on. In all honesty, I don't think there was a bad seat in the house but if you were on the lower level, you might not get a full view of the whole thing, although if you are down there, you will be right in the action as the actors often passed down the aisles to reach the stage, including a giant elephant in the opening scene...just incredible!	7	5	What a show!!! A must see for all ages!	Sislee
9	October 1, 2013	This is an absolutely brilliant show. We had seats in the Mezzanine, Row C, seats 122 & 123 and had a perfect view. We collected our tickets about an hour before the show started so no delay with queues. Only negative is a very limited selection of refreshments at very high prices. My husband, who wouldn't be in to musicals at all, also thought it was brilliant. Overall, very enjoyable show and great seats. Can't wait to see The Lion King again.	4	5	Fantastic - really enjoyed it	IrishGal010
23	October 1, 2013	My husband and I bought tickets to the Lion King several days before our visit to New York and are so happy we did! Of course, tickets are over $100 each if you buy them in advance, but that's to be expected for a Broadway show.  I went into the show somewhat knowing what to expect having seen clips of the show for the past several years, but my husband had no idea and went in with low expectations of a show with people dressed as animals! It was a very fitting time for us to see The Lion King, as we just returned from a Tanzanian safari in July and watched The Lion King movie while we were on safari!  The show was so much fun for kids and adults. The actors were fantastic, especially Scar's character and spot on with the characters from the movie. I'd definitely recommend this musical for anyone wishing to see a classic that won't disappoint!	22	5	A unique musical!	TravelGirlwithPups
44	October 1, 2013	My partner and I went to see the show in New York and it was fantastic! He does not enjoy musicals so I knew it was a good one when even he thought it was great! The props and sets are world class. Highly recommend!	34	5	Really Enjoyed It!	HMM23
261	September 27, 2013	My wife and I have been to countless shows and by far the Lion King is one of the most memorable, mesmerizing, captivating show on Broadway. The characters come alive with the music while telling a great story. Book some nice tickets early and take our advice go have a great time	191	5	One of the best Broadway shows	George710
44	September 30, 2013	The best show I have ever seen. There is nothing to dislike about this show. Well acted wonderful and seasoned characters. Everyone stood at the end of the show and applauded continuously. I sincerely think the amount we paid was too small. We sat on the mezzanine floor up and got a very great view of the show.	20	5	Great broadway show	nene_iwl
43	September 30, 2013	Awesome show. The children loved it and even 6 months later the songs are still being sung around the house	19	5	Well worth while	kjmcd66
53	September 30, 2013	We paid $165 each for the tickets and we were bang in the centre and could not have asked for better seats. Great show and really worthwhile seeing it. This was my first Broadway show.	22	5	great show and great seats.	27Alan87
43	September 24, 2013	Best broadway show I have seen, what an awesome night! Would see it again when they travel to other cities! Great show for all ages, everyone seemed to be having a great time and the theater was gorgeous, with some great views of Times Square.	12	5	Awesome	TangoMN2013
18	September 25, 2013	It was my first show in Broadway and it was very fun, the characters are great and It amazed me how the animals came to life with the creative costumes, the music was the most remarkable thing for me. The theater was full so I recommend to buy the tickets on advanced 1 or 2 days before, I bought the 99USD tickets and was seating on the very last row but the view was great. There were plenty of small child who had lots of fun but got a bit scared with Scar, there are some characters that really make you laugh out loud. I do recommend it.	5	5	Fun to watch, specially if you grew with the movie	delpalaciodaniel
5	September 25, 2013	Look, if you love Lion King, you'll love this spectacular, creative feast for your eyes. The lighting is outstanding, the singing, dancing - it's all brilliant. I was blown away by how they pulled certain pieces off and when it cones time for the tension, the orchestra just accentuates it wonderfully. So if it's up and in broadway while you're there - don't hesitate.	5	5	Blown away.	Jesse M
99	September 26, 2013	Extremely entertaining. A must-see for any fan of the Lion King! Great theatre too, and good value for money.	92	4	Fantastic show!	JacyntaKate
52	September 22, 2013	Great music, acting and pretty cool costumes. This show is sold out pretty much every night so buy your tickets in advance if you can.	47	4	Fabulous Costumes	BrianM55
130	September 23, 2013	It has become the quintessential Broadway musical... for tourists, at least. Great songs, fantastic sets and a story that everyone knows and loves (perfect musical for the whole family)... you'll get goosebumps. The first rows in the mezzanine provide a great view and you can save a few (just a few) bucks from top priced seats. Please, try to get your tickets several months in advance (no discount options, not even at TKTS).	61	5	Must see	Dominique0810
621	September 24, 2013	"Hard to believe...wanted to see Lion King too. Friday night and place was packed as it was a sunny day in the city. Show began with precision performances, creative costumes and a beautiful stage. BUT...people's heads all around us started bobbing side to side. The woman in front of me maybe stayed awake for a total of 15 minutes. I fought it tooth and nail but nodded off and hit my husband's shoulder to the point he thought ""oh no I am going to fall asleep now!"" Intermission - told first staffer we found all about it and headed to restroom. Yep, line for women was snaking around the beverage area ( $$$ avoid at all cost). I made it to restroom with about 15 behind me waiting when a staffer said for women to use the facility on the next floor. Tried to get to seats but were told we had to wait for the performers to run through aisles onto stage. We waited and waited until my husband gave me the ""thumb's out"" to leave. Had to have been 88 to 90 degrees in the theatre and it was a total waste of everyone's energy and money that evening. Sorry Lion King - can not suggest until the weather turned chilly!"	243	3	Had to WALK OUT due to temp in theatre	Alexa8776
38	September 24, 2013	Do yourself a favour and take yourself and your family to see this show while you are visiting NYC. All seating is good.	8	5	A Must See while in NYC	Marion W
11	September 18, 2013	We saw a few shows and this was by far the very best show. interactive as the performers would come through the isles and the costumes and acting was outstanding!! worth every penny!! 	4	5	the best!	danniyou
26	September 19, 2013	This is a must see! It is hard to put in words! You just need to go and experience it! I paid full price for our tickets, as I was afraid I wouldn't get them and it was worth every penny. 	18	5	Awesome experience!	Mary B
27	September 20, 2013	What a great experience!!!! From start to finish this show was incredible! The actors are so talented and have such beautiful voices!! We had a great seat and the actors ran right past us down the aisles! Anyone thinking about seeing the lion king, you definitely should!! Hands down one of the best shows I've ever seen!! So impressed. Beautiful theatre as well.	8	5	A must see!	Julia M
9	September 21, 2013	The costumes and songs are out of this world!! I would highly recommend seeing it. Loved every minute of it!!	3	5	One of the best	Kathy H
82	September 16, 2013	Took my son to his first Broadway show and this one hit the mark. The music, sounds, lighting and overall stimuli was enough to keep him engaged and entertained. BRAVO to the orchestra for their fabulous performance....the peaks and lulls were solid without ever missing a cue. If your looking for a family show that isn't overly complicated with a great story line; then this is for you. Just keep things in perspective and you'll have a great time.	45	5	Lion King Provided a Matinee of Memories	NJM0Mof1
23	September 16, 2013	Go see the show it's worth every penny! The staff at the theater aren't the friendliest but hey it's New York. We were towards the back of the orchestra section and had a perfect view of the show. I don't imagine there are any seats with a bad view in the whole place.	14	5	Beautiful show, nice theater!	LuvMyDoxie83
136	September 16, 2013	This is amazing show ever! I think the music, dance, costumes, wardrobe is great. Feeling excited to see this show.  Recommended broadway show you need to see before you died!	138	5	Broadway show you need to see before you died!	arnoldusIndonesia
993	September 17, 2013	Saw this show over 10 years ago. We were visiting the city with family and this was something appropriate for all so I attended again. Costumes still stunning and creative but the sets seem rather bland after seeing shows like Wicked where the sets are a big Wow. Simple story that after one viewing was enough.	326	4	Still Good but Feeling Dated	Fondue4two
396	September 12, 2013	My wife treated me to the Lion King for my birthday. What a fantastic show. I was captivated from start to finish. Superb sets, great acting and incredible costumes. Loved every moment	391	5	Simply superb	GGGSarnia
14	September 14, 2013	The show was superb and didn't disappoint in any way. The costumes were amazing and the singers superb. We were right at the back and top of the theatre and still had great seats at a good price too.	5	5	Stunning	Gail B
35	September 15, 2013	Without giving too much away about the show you will not be disappointed by the costumes or the performance. there was never a dull moment and at times you forgot that they are actors and not animals/anmination	22	5	A must see, amazing	Ian_Tasha
115	September 15, 2013	While this isn't a classic, we loved the show! I am a big Disney fan, and I certainly like the storyline. The casting was great, and the staging and costumes were magnificent! So creative!!! We would recommend this to anyone wanting to see a Broadway show!	44	5	Cool Show!	SandEseetheworld
54	September 8, 2013	Great musical! Both beautiful and funny! Stunning how they created all the animals in the story! It was definently an expirience!	21	5	Great!	Tusseluss
45	September 9, 2013	Great show, from start to finish, made the movie version come alive. Child actors were excellent. The singing orchestra were superb. 	32	4	Best show in town 	Smck5
83	September 10, 2013	What a show! We had one of the most affordable chairs but it was a great view. Loved it! The story itself isn't why you go here, the ever changing costumes and setting are fantastic.	32	5	Great show	RenateVink
7	September 11, 2013	I had seen this 10 years ago. I forgot how moving, gorgeous, and original it is. It completely stands the test of time, and we saw five Broadway shows in three days. This was the best.	106	5	Completely Gorgeous, and Well Worth it	totripadv
141	September 6, 2013	The show is considered a Broadway classic now and more than a decade after its opening it still manages to impress. Costumes and scenery are top notch and the songs (mostly) were catchy and fun. The vibe is energetic and great for kids of all ages (and adults too)	43	5	The Lion King Still Roars	KJDC19
99	September 7, 2013	The costumes, scene decorations and music are phenomenal. Is it a musical per se? Not so much... Not a lot of singing solos or dancing is going on I would say it is more of a modern dance show rather than a musical. It is really geared much more towards families with children and I am certain they would LOVE the show. If you are adults I would say go to rock of ages	53	3	Great for children, not so much for adults	wacko_654
6	September 8, 2013	Great show for 6 and up, and adults all around! Wonderful costumes and up to date story line. Way to go Elton John and Kudos for the costumes and Direction Julie Taymor! 	3	5	What costumes!!!	webtique
58	September 8, 2013	The puppetry is simply amazing. So good that after a while you stop seeing the costumes and the set and just get caught up in the story. So glad we saw this. 	24	5	Fascinating	Sin712
20	September 4, 2013	We took our granddaughter for her 13th birthday, and we were very impressed. It is a great show, and we made wonderful memories. 	65	5	Loved it!	Wanda F
87	September 4, 2013	This was my second time seeing The Lion King this time with my granddaughter. Just watching her face made the play even better. The Lion King is a treat for people of any age. The ticket prices are high, but the show is worth the price. Very enjoyable!	35	5	Better than the First Time	Katie J
17	September 4, 2013	As a first time theatre goer this performance was not what i had in mind, however it was brilliant! Funny, witty and entertaining the entire time even the children in the rows in front of me were quiet. Definitely worth seeing!	5	4	not what i expected	alvec1
215	September 4, 2013	The storyline, characters, scenery, costumes and puppetry will blow your mind. Even if you've seen it on tour, seeing in Broadway is like nothing else! The whole family loves this one!	89	5	A classic on Broadway!	sanguinewanderer
15	September 3, 2013	My 11-year-old daughter & I absolutely LOVED the show. The performers, costumes, stage set-up, music, everything about the show was spectacular. We had front row balcony seats on the right side of the stage. The seats were fantastic, but in looking around the theater, I don't think there really was a bad seat in the house. The staff was very friendly and my daughter got autographs from the performers after the show, complete with pictures. Fabulous time and I would definitely see it again. Anytime!	3	5	LION KING!	SMR0308
34	September 3, 2013	"This was by far the best show I have ever seen. After 15 minutes my son turned to me and said, ""If I don't see any more...this has been worth it!"	7	5	UNBELIEVABLE	Robineggl
7	September 3, 2013	The Lion King is must see for all ages. Interesting musical for people of all ages. It kept my attention from beginning to end. Beware, the theater is not accessible. 	4	5	A Great Musical!	lgr2_13
53	September 3, 2013	Husband surprised me for my birthday with fantastic fourth row center section seating for The Lion King! When we were discussing going before, I dismissed the thought of going because of the ticket price. However, sitting there from the very start, you can see that you are in for a treat. I'm an adult and could hardly take in all the majesty, creativity, and movements that go into this awesome and ambitious production. In short, no one leaves disappointed from the performance--it's a must see for all ages!	20	5	The Lion King is rich with Disney imagination and innovation!	T L
75	September 2, 2013	Absolutley fantastic, the show was even better than expected. Want to go again! Sat at front right of mezzanine, great view.	49	5	Breathtaking	Lynne K
8	September 2, 2013	Hands down best production I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of musicals!!! The costuming is incredible, cast extremely talented, music beautiful, the list is never-ending! I sat in the front row which I was worried would be bad, but it was perfectly fine, in fact I really enjoyed the front row in this show! They rotate two actors to play young Simba, and the one for my show was so talented. Most amazing kid I've ever seen!  This show is a little pricey, but absolutely worth it. On another note, I don't recommend bringing really young children to this show, the approx. 5 year old kids behind me were very scared by the show, and their mother had to try to convince them that it wasn't real after the show ended.	1	5	MUST SEE THE LION KING!!!	Jaclyn M
13	September 3, 2013	Very impressive show, from the opening number when an elephant walked onstage to the hyneas, to the whole story. Very well done. We had two young girls with us (my daughter and a friend) and they were on the edge of their seats the whole show.	7	5	Wow, what costumes and acting	Tom C
43	September 3, 2013	Anything Disney related has always been good, However this live Theartre production is excellent. The costumes are just amazing. 	9	5	This is a Great Show	Rlane2
27	August 26, 2013	We had initally booked this when the broadway folks were on strike an dgot out money back...and finally went to it and absouletly loved it! This is not jsut for kids as is assumed......	7	5	Yearly Broadway show	Hema R
26	August 28, 2013	It was really good - but I think I probably expected more for the price that we paid for this. But all in all a great evening and worth seeing.	5	3	Lion King	Hantzl
713	August 28, 2013	We went to see the Lion King on Tuesday evening and had a wonderful time. The music was wonderful. The costumes and set up were good. Had a wonderful time.	224	5	Very entertaining	kimsX7442XV
25	August 29, 2013	You don't need to be aware of the musical scene for loving this musical. It's an obligatory activity during your stay in the city. With outstanding performances of the cast and a scenery which gets you flabbergasted, you're gonna love it from the beggining to the end.	9	5	Not only for musical Lovers	DFreitas
24	August 29, 2013	It was amazing its a must see! Worth every penny. Not a big fan of shows but this really made the holiday for me 	16	5	Amazing	Becky G
62	August 30, 2013	The theatre is very beautful, you can get a spectacular view from Broadway by the window! The play is unbelievable, the scenes, cast, everything is amazing!	21	4	Amazing	Paulalie03
41	August 31, 2013	But this one I loved, it´s so beautiful, the costumes, the masks, the mechanic devices that emulates the movement of the animals, the music, the singing, the theater, everything on it is great.	17	5	I don´t like musicals	gabriela s
39	August 31, 2013	I know most people rave about this very long running show, but my wife & I could not get past the very odd costumes & head gear the performers wear - it was a huge distraction & big negative. This is the fault of the producers / director & production designer, as the performers did the best they could given what they had to work with. Of course the music was great. 	6	3	Very strange costumes.	1Kenneth1
9	September 1, 2013	It was a delightful experience seeing this show. It was sometimes funny, sometimes moving. The audience responded with enthusiastic applause through the entire performance,	3	5	Wonderful performance	Yvonne W
101	August 23, 2013	Really enjoyed the show but I have seen better in the West End and tickets booked direct were very expensive	38	3	Good show but not up with the best	Alan H
70	August 23, 2013	"We took our two teens and they absolutely loved it. They weren't too sure what to expect but two seconds after the show started they were ""hooked"". They were in awe of how the story is told. It was a dream come true to see this production on Broadway. It truly is awesome, and so worth every penny. "	24	5	"2 teenagers - ""That was awesome!"""	watergirl341
68	August 24, 2013	The costumes first take your breath away, then the music sweeps you up into the arms of the story. I laughed, cried, cheered and clapped like crazy. I bought my tickets online before I even left Canada. 	21	5	If you see nothing else in your life, go see the Lion KIng	ComoxBibian
35	October 8, 2013	my fourth time taking different grandchildren to see this show. It is always wonderful. They keep upgrading and changing the scenery without losing the magic of the show.	10	5	a roaring show	vivian197728
39	October 10, 2013	The Lion KIng was not the first on my list, when I was in New York, but at such a short notice it was we had no option. Therefore, I would suggest if you are planning a new days in the 'Big Apple' try and arrange theatre tickets before you go as it was very expensive and I am sure yu can purchase cheaper from the UK. You have to be at the theatre on time and if you are not then you do not get in, which I thought was a very good idea as you did not have people coming in late. I did not really know much about the show but it was really good and and I thoroughly enjoyed. I was not sure that my Brother in law would appreciate it but he really enjoyed it and said he would see it again.	13	5	A very enjoyable evening	lesleyj_morgan
92	October 14, 2013	Go ahead, make the reservation, It's amazing, you cannot loose, It's a completely different kind of play you could imagine from Disney and Lion King. Excellent. Worth the price !	27	5	Perfect. Do not Miss	JGFromCWB
217	October 15, 2013	We had heard how good Lion King was and we were not disappointed! I was amazed at the costumes and how the actors gave the animals the correct mannerisms. You forgot they were humans! Love the music! It was an enjoyable afternoon.	51	4	Amazing costumes!	Valerie F
16	October 21, 2013	I persoanlly love the move and had to go see this. The way they interact and music it's just amazing. I cant wait until my son is old enough to go watch it. 	34	5	In Love with Lion King	Jmv247
122	October 19, 2013	It seems like it has been around for ever -- and deservedly so. Great for both kids and adults -- the songs, costumes, acting are all first rate. A not-to-be-missed show if you have limited time in New York.	74	5	One of the best on Broadway	Elliot J
27	October 22, 2013	A great program for kids and adults. Is amazing how the artists stage the animals moves and the story is very truthfull to the movie. 	7	5	A real treat! 	Stella O
38	October 17, 2013	The beginning of the show could be the climax as all the animals come down the aisles toward the stage. There is truly not a bad seat in the entire theater. The acting was wonderful (the man playing Mufasa has apparently been in that role for 10 years). The costumes are fantastic. The only complaint I have is that in the play, Scar wants to be with adult-Nala - as in marry her. I don't know why the writers added this tangent to the story but it is truly unnecessary. Amazing performance by an amazing cast!	28	5	Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!	Lesleykay
222	October 24, 2013	I went to this show because we thought the kids we had with us (7,8 nieces and my 16yr old daughter) would like it. It diidn't matter to me at the time. As long as the kids enjoyed it, all is good. Well... what a show! The costumes and theatrics were out of this world. There's a ton of work that goes into this production and it showed. An excellent venue as well. It was nothing less than suberb! I am now fan and would go again in a heartbeat. Nothing to contemplate here. Just go. You'll see! :)	64	5	Awesome show!	JohnN59
6	October 27, 2013	The acting was great and the sets were fantastic but the singing (sound) let the performance down.. the show still has the magic of Disney	2	4	Lion King revisited ..x 3	Graham G
13	October 29, 2013	"Everyone has seen it - but no one ever told me that I must see this show. I've lived in Manhattan for 23 years and no one ever said ""you MUST see this show."" So I'm telling you... if you haven't already...YOU MUST SEE THIS SHOW!!! The talent, the set, the ANIMALS (costumes), the songs!!! It's all amazing! It will blow your mind! Don't wait till Lion King is gone. Go see it today!!  And if all else fails and you go and you still don't like it, go for the photo op view when you come down the escalators inside. The windows overlook Times Square and it's the view you wish you had on New Years Eve! :)"	7	5	"Why hasn't everyone told me to ""see this show?"""	sukiacki
195	November 3, 2013	As a loose fan of theatre, I'd say that this is one of the best shows I've ever been to. Paid approx £225 for 4 tickets but it was well worth it to be close yo the section. Get a seat by the aisle if you can as some of the action happens here. 	96	4	Excellent show for adults & kids alike	mail4matt
222	November 5, 2013	This was a great show for both kids and adults. If you enjoyed the movie, you will like this. The actors are great especially Scar. He was the best one and Zazu! the songs were great and the special effects were amazing. All the seats are great. I would definitely recommend. 	190	5	great play for kids and adults	noelle1156
2	November 8, 2013	My 14 year old daughter and I attended a matinee show. I don't think I have ever heard such wonderful singing in my life before! The actors were wonderful and the puppetry of the animals was brilliant! We LOVED it!!	3	5	Amazing show!	Susie6409
31	November 13, 2013	If there is only one show you can see on Broadway this should be it. The costuming is so different to that of any other show around - so creative and quite stunning. At the start of the show when the animals come down from the back of the theatre, close enough that you could touch them, you will find yourself moved to tears - they are phenomenal and as large as life. The actors performed brilliantly, the story was clear and the sets brilliant. Photos and videos are not permitted but the program for the show was not too expensive and provided a perfect reminder of a magical night - the culmination of a long-held dream to see a Broadway show. We saw others whilst we were in New York, but this is the one that will remain with us forever. It is worth paying for good seats for what can only be a once in a lifetime experience for so many of us.	22	5	Broadway at its best	Grizabellachinchilla
64	November 21, 2013	What an amazing show! The performance was great. We enjoyed it immensely and definitely recommend it!	28	5	Brilliant!	DayungBidayuh
42	November 25, 2013	The Lion KIng is my favorite Disney movie and I heard tremendous reviews. It was a very good play but not my alltime favorite. Young Simba and Nala were terrific, 	26	4	I had higher expectations	gof16
59	November 26, 2013	A must see for families or couples. Enjoyed it from start to finish. For added fun go next door for cheesecake and coffee from Juniors.	55	5	Brilliant	Brendan M
107	November 27, 2013	My kids were mesmerized from star to finish! Beautiful custumes, enchanting set up, creative dancing, excellent production!	48	5	Loved it!	EnfantsDoc
11	November 28, 2013	Fantastic!!! Went with my husband. It was amazing, the sets were incredible. Would definitely go again	6	5	The Lion King	Lulu086
58	November 29, 2013	I went to the show with my daugters and my in law. We decides to go on the same day, so we bought tickets 1/2 hour before beginning. Very good and a really amazing scene change Loved it like everything from Disney :-)	14	5	fantastic !	babysu
4	November 25, 2013	This show is a MUST SEE. It is a little pricey but it really doesn't matter where you sit. This was my second time seeing this play and I would still go and see it over and over. 	3	5	AMAZING unforgettable show	Jaine P
166	November 25, 2013	We missed this show when we were first visited NYC in 2005. We watched Fiddler on the Roof instead. This time around in 2013 after attending my daughter's graduation we made sure we got tickets to the show. Great show, enjoyable. Must see.	183	5	Entertaining	zzmelayu
5	November 24, 2013	Loved the theatre, close to Times Square, plenty of room for legs etc and helpful staff and the show was totally enthralling and mesmerising for every age.	48	5	Totally enjoyable	Paul F
4	November 15, 2013	Animals were great,music and singing disappointing ,not recommended. No indication of the excellence of Elton John.	31	2	Samba	Michael S
23	November 22, 2013	Fantastic show with interesting costume designs! Definitely worth a watch - you won't be disappointed! 	9	5	Fab!	Jenny S
31	November 16, 2013	Took my 7 year old daughter to see he Lion King while were visiting New York for a long weekend. It was a highlight of the trip.  Great performances. Would recommend to anyone!	113	5	Great performance!	esgordon
307	November 17, 2013	so real and one of the best on broadway. The seats on row N orchestra were great, seems all seats in the house were great, it was so interactive which made the effects amazing. It involved the audience. its a must see with kids as well. 	67	5	Amazing effects	meworldtraveller
86	November 18, 2013	this is a show not to be missed. we had 5th row center orchestra...well worth the money!!! there is so much going on throughout the play, there is no time to get bored. the puppetry and costumes were awesome!!!	157	5	PHENOMENAL	doubletrip
19	November 9, 2013	Went with husband and 8 year old daughter and it was amazing! the costumes and sets make this show simply incredible. 	5	5	Spectacular	sheclimber
67	November 10, 2013	Very fun show, even for adults. While it is similar to the Disney's Lion King, it adds a few songs and has a unique vibe.  We sat in the front row of the mezzanine; it was a great choice! The actors come into the audience (not in an annoying way) and the puppets are huge, so it was better than sitting close to the stage.  The actors and songs were wonderful, especially the kids playing young Simba and Nala! Would recommend.	17	5	Great show on Broadway	emily13anne
319	November 12, 2013	"My 19-year-old daughter picked this show, out of all others, to see on our Broadway weekend. She chose wisely.  The show was fun for the whole family. I was enthralled by the costuming of the animal characters. The giraffes and elephants were amazing. So were the costumes of actors who literally played grass. The stage set was incredible. The way ""Pride Rock"" rose out of the floor was wonderful.  The singing and dancing was exactly what I'd expect from a Disney production on Broadway. Top notch A-one practically perfect in every way. The only down-side for me was the cost of concessions. Way overpriced! Sneak in some candy and a bottle of water if you want to save some serious cash. "	191	5	Incredible Set and Costumes!	TVDad
21	November 12, 2013	The Lion King on Broadway is such an incredible performance. You give so much credit to the people in these outrageously amazing costumes. It is so hard to pull off an amazing show while working with the puppets, and the big head costume. The performers were absolutely amazing, and couldn't have been better. From the singing, the acting, the dancing, and the costumes the whole show was wonderful. The theater was beautiful and the experience was lovely. Definitely a must see!	13	5	Spectacular! Just an amazing performance	Stina333
36	November 6, 2013	We loved everything about the show and the theater. The music, costumes and sets are incredible. The theater is very nice and it seemed like a good view from every seat. The refreshments were a little expensive but that was expected. I hope to go back some time in the future and sit up close.	17	5	The Lion King is fantastic!	Jennifer P
19	November 6, 2013	This is a heart-warming musical because it reminds you of the watching the movie. Great story line and amazing actors, especially the kids. If you only have time to see one show, see The Lion King!	6	5	The must-see musical!	Wendy M
44	November 7, 2013	This is by far one of the best musicals on Broadway. You will be blown away by the costume design and the performances. There even comes a time when you are so immersed in the performance that you do not see actors in costumes, but you would swear they are real talking animals. A must see for Disney and non Disney fans of all ages and fans of Broadway musicals	41	5	If you must see one musical. the Lion King is it	RafaelECruz7
11	November 7, 2013	In the first minute I had goosebumps. Even my fiance (who isn't really into Theatre) had the same reaction. The whole show was incredible and the actors are so talented. I have always wanted to see The Lion King and was so grateful that my first experience of Broadway was this show. I would recommend this to anyone!! This is a must see!!	6	5	MUST SEE	Courtney_P331
96	November 3, 2013	Just off time square, the place is buzzing. Colourfully with beautiful singing. Highly recommend it.	34	4	A great nights entertainment	IRLWX1
37	November 3, 2013	As a fan of the theater, I knew I had to watch a Broadway show when I visited New York last December. The only question was which one. I'd seen 'Phantom of the Opera' a few years ago and my boyfriend had seen 'Wicked,' so we decided on 'The Lion King.' The show started off wonderfully--the costumes were beautifully imaginative, the singing was great and we were thoroughly enjoying the performance...until after intermission, when suddenly, Simba became British. His accent was really distracting for the rest of the show. And the scene where Scar and Simba duke it out was anticlimactic due to Scar's melodramatic acting. Everything else was great, but those two things (pretty major things for a Broadway musical, in my opinion) kind-of ruined my experience (I don't even want to see it when the traveling group comes to Hawaii).	53	3	Beautiful Broadway Musical With a Few Issues	iceskater48
146	November 4, 2013	Sitting near the front was the perfect seating choice, the costumes music and entire production is fantastic. The guy who plays Skar is fantastic !! what a voice.... love love love it :)	68	5	Amazeballs	Tracy006
12	November 5, 2013	this was a great show but as usual at the end they asked for more money,just wish we could have paid for something and that was it, but oh no we were in New York.	6	5	superb	CURLY95
27	October 29, 2013	A classic, what can you say about this beautiful production. Always good acting and most leads are excellent vocalists. Julie Tamor was amazing with her creation. Costumes are the best of any show ever created. Children love this show and adults also....now if we could just get those ticket costs down... I purchased three and the cost was $500. Would have loved to see another show on this visit into the city, but could not do to high ticket costs. This theatre has the poorest bathrooms... few stalls n a long wait... lines easily take  15 minutes at intermisson.	20	5	great, do not miss,perfect for all ages	p m
25	October 31, 2013	Have been wanting to see this ever since it first opened and it was worth the wait. I would have gone again if we had the opportunity. Would recommend this to everyone.	12	5	Loved the show	crazie-girlie
67	November 1, 2013	My boyfriend took me to see this on Valentine's day and we sat in the front row. It was amazing and I'd definitely see it again. It was true to the movie with some variations. The costumes were magnificent. I loved singing along to the songs. I've been seeing musicals every year all of my life, but never wanted to spend so much money to see this. Don't hold back, it really is worth seeing!	13	5	Awesome musical	Julie R
211	November 2, 2013	I've heard about this show for so many years, that it was a must see when we were in NYC. Great costumes and great music. There were a few times when it was hard to hear what the performers were saying, but, overall, it was great. 	99	5	Great Performance	BDAHiFlyer
152	October 28, 2013	I am really going against the crowd on this one, the opening scene is stunning. The puppetry is very clever but the show really didn't hold my attention. The rest of the family enjoyed it so i have to give it four out of five.	123	4	Good, but not for me	MDUK
14	October 28, 2013	Went here for a date night with my fiance, it was awesome.  I'm not a musical person but I enjoyed every moment of this Broadway show! This show was funny and brought me back to my childhood.  I can't want to go back with my family.	10	5	LOVED IT!	emmy m
2	October 28, 2013	If you plan on watching this show.....GET A SEAT THAT'S AT THE ORCHESTRA LEVEL! I don't want to ruin the surprise, but you will NOT regret it. The show was awesome and you will have fun watching it	3	5	AWESOME SHOW!	Calvin C
57	October 29, 2013	What a fantastic evening! We were lucky to get seats very close to the stage. Brilliant family show. Great for all ages. 	29	5	Lion king	SamS462
18	October 25, 2013	In my opinion the best show on Broadway. Great for adults and kids alike. Costumes and scenery were incredible. Left the theatre buzzing, would definitely go again.	5	5	Spectacular	AJC2426
13	October 26, 2013	Very good show at Broadway. It is extremely well organized. Lots of kids in the theather. I would recommend for youngs and adults. Expensive, though...	4	5	Lion King	WorldTravellerAlways
2	October 26, 2013	This show was great. The theater is great we were in the very last row and still could see everything it was amazing	1	5	First Ever Broadway Show	Laura C
70	October 27, 2013	What an experience! I have seen many musical but this blew me away! The costumes, staging, set design, makeup....everything! It was such an experience that i would recommed to anyone. I have seen many shows but it was a first for my partner and he enjoyed just as much as I did. The Theatre was fantastic, great staff and a great bar serving themed cocktails....a touch expensive at $16 each but worth every penny! We got tickets the day before from the theatre box office and the seats were fantastic - reasonable price for the side circle row 2. It was a great view without paying premium prices. We loved every second and cant recommend it highly enough!!	57	5	If you only see one show, make it this one!	nicola b
7	October 22, 2013	What a tremendous show! I'd seen it twice before in Australia but wanted my kids (aged 12 & 10) to experience it. They loved it, couldn't get the smile off their faces. And even though I'd seen it, I was still amazed. It is truly a brilliant show. Well worth the $$	4	5	Amazing!	Karen D
39	October 23, 2013	what a spectacular sow so glad we took in the show we will recommend it to everyone !!We have never experienced a live show such as this and we thought it was fantastic !!	37	5	First live show for us	siljeff
23	October 23, 2013	Sat in orchestra seats with great view of stage. Performance was amazing, with costumes, puppetry, dance, and music. Very helpful to follow storyline if you have seen the animated movie before going to the play. They did a great job of casting. 	8	5	As good as it gets	j1007
11	October 24, 2013	I'm so glad we choose to see this show, there is so much choice on Broadway and off but absolutely loved this. The set and cast were amazing and truly enjoyed the whole experience. . The singing sent shivers down my spine at times. It is definitely worth the $$ and I'm sorry now that we didn't spend that little bit extra for a better seat.	6	5	Amazing Show	Discover18
8	October 21, 2013	Breath taking show, everything was simply amazing! Loved the songs, the costumes and all the actors... Worth every dollar!!! Would go again tomorrow...	3	5	INCREDIBLY	Francesca402
7	October 21, 2013	The Lion King on Broadway was wonderful. It was great songs and the singing was GREAT! My husband and I enjoyed every minute. It was awesome to watch the movie come to life with real actors, special effects, songs and the costumes were terrific! Highly recommend!	3	5	The Best!	MrsSmith81613
4	October 21, 2013	If you loved The Lion King animated film, you will LOVE this musical! I could watch it over and over again.	2	5	Must-watch musical!	desi8517
35	October 22, 2013	Great sound, fabulous cast, amazing score...loved every moment. This amazing show, even though seen before in London, delighted me from start to finish. Every character was so perfect for the part. The puppetry mesmerises me. 	29	5	So much better than the London version mainly due to the Minskoff Theatre	MichelleBosh
187	October 19, 2013	This was the third time I had seen Lion King, and it was as good the 3rd time as the 1st! To get the best view of the stage, opt for rear Orchestra or front mezzanine seats. A classic well worth the money.	93	4	Great show	wewannagoagain
82	October 20, 2013	"Were given ""The Lion King"" broadway tickets for Christmas two years ago. It was a phenomenal show. This is also my first time seeing a broadway show but it will definitely not be my last. The performers were excellent. I think it was better than the movie. Another thing I want to say is that there are advantages and disadvantages to the seating. If you sat on the mezzanine you were able to see the orchestras play.. however you aren't able to see the performers up close when they come down the aisle. But nonetheless, it was an excellent show and I cannot wait to see more broadway shows in the future."	18	5	GREAT SHOW	vivian_ferri
30	October 20, 2013	I went to Africa for 3 months in 2008 and oh boy did this bring back such amazing memories!  Through the whole show I had goosebumps.. the costumes, the songs, the voices!  Just truly remarkable and so wonderful!!  Big thumbs up for anyone wanting to go!  Book tickets in advance as they do go quickly.. I did notice however when we were picking up ours that there is a standby list for people who dont show up.  Def come prepared to have a great night and get blown away by the performance!	9	5	LOVED IT!	Lovepuffin_blogspot
8	October 20, 2013	$400 for 2 tickets....it was worth maybe 1/4 that in my opinion. If you've seen the film, leave it at that, unless you have kids, but remember mufasa dies yo, they may cry.	3	3	Not what I expected	Robert B
7	October 17, 2013	This would have been my first broadway show ever, and what better then to see it in New York , there was so much shows to see, we decided to go to the lion king and I am so glad we did, what a wonderful way to spend the evening the cast and the scenery was so realistic to the real thing and I even bought a souvenir to bring home to remind me of the great night I saw my first broadway show. 	4	5	Shows	suzi59
3	October 18, 2013	Absolutely breath-taking!!! The set, the music, the songs, actors - everything keeps you in your seat and makes you want to ask for an encore! a MUST SEE!	26	5	An amazing show!	Kora G
8	October 18, 2013	I've seen quite a few plays / musicals on broadway, and this has been by far my favorite so far!!! Fantasic performers, great costumes, wonderful sets - it's all good! 	1	5	Best Musical!	Nicole W
21	October 18, 2013	Do NOT miss this fabulous performance! Superb artistry--costumes, music, acting, etc. all were tops!	9	5	Lion King (of the jungle)	Kerry S
73	October 15, 2013	This performance absolutely blew me away from the opening scene! The costumes are amazing! So beautiful, so detailed, so elegant. The performers voices were outstanding. The way they moved with the costumes almost made you forget they were not real! Absolutely worth the cost of tickets. Also the theater it's self is just beautiful.	23	5	Phenomenal!	Jsmithyman
13	October 16, 2013	"The sounds, pageantry and costumes were excellent. My wife enjoyed it much more than I. We purchased ""Orchestra"" seating thinking we would be up front. NO!! We were all the way in the back. When asked about it, they said that all of their seats were considered Orchestra seating...HUH?? Anyway, descent play but would personally not want to sit through it again."	6	3	Guess I'm not a Disney fan	Leo R
37	October 16, 2013	The costumes are great and the story charming. The Theater is not large but very nice.  For this performance spend the extra money and try to get as close to the stage as possible because the costumes are amazing and you truely want to see as much as you can. The costumes and creativity are what make this broadway performance incredible. 	12	4	Very good performance	wke18
99	October 16, 2013	My partner and I have never been to a Broadway musical before, so decided to fork out a bit of money to get front row seats. We were so close, you could see the sweat dripping off the actors! haha The opening act made me cry and it was just absolutely AMAZING! The performers are so talented. This is just a must see when coming to NYC! Worth every single :) :)	79	5	A whole new meaning to theatre	Lauren C
156	October 14, 2013	The show was better than expected. The costumes, decor and characters were excellent ! We know the story, but they did a good job to pull you into the story. They did a great job to appeal to varied audience - kids to adults.	55	5	Wonderful !!	Dennis_M99_MTL
37	October 14, 2013	I picked this show as our one Broadway experience because I wanted something me and my teenage son could enjoy with good music. However it was the costumes and staging that wowed us most. The cast have to sing, dance and manipulate their costumes at the same time! The humour worked better than the sad parts which could drag a little, especially as we all know the story, but it was still wonderfully evocative and a great choice for all ages. There were tiny children in the theatre who were silent because they were captivated. I pre booked expensive seats in the orchestra but balcony seats would be a good choice. I had someone's head just in front of me blocking centre stage. You would not get that higher up but you might not see as much detail on the costumes or expressions on faces. I don't know if it is normal but there was a standing ovation for the performance I went to. There were some excellent performances by the cast...too many to list.	13	5	Stunning costumes and staging	FranceMesange
5	October 14, 2013	This was my second time seeing Lion King. If possible it was even better than the first. Probably because we were in the sixth row from the stage. This is a masterpiece like no other. I can't imagine anyone walking away at the end and not loving this show! Worth every penny. And then some!!	2	5	Must See To Believe!	Catherine L
6	October 15, 2013	Amazing show with great performances! Highly recommend for families. I would recommend seats a little further back (2 of us were in the 5th row) to see the entire parade of performers coming down the aisles.	278	5	Beautiful	Nancy S
30	October 10, 2013	Costuming, music, excellent seats. Terrific production. We loved The Lion King and all agreed we would definitely go to see this Broadway show again. GREAT!	17	5	Going to The Lion King	JimmyeG
10	October 10, 2013	Yes, I just can say..THE best Broadway Show , is amazing and wonderful, I want to see again ! very hight recommended. Un espectáculo increíble , lo recordare por siempre y lo recomiendo al 100%.	1	5	The BEST!	Dodo1264
153	October 12, 2013	Great show. We booked early and got great seats at the front of the balcony. If you get the chance to see it, do.	121	5	Fantastic	Richiewoodhouse
16	October 12, 2013	This show is perfect for people of all ages. The singing and acting is more than adequate for a long-running Broadway show, however, it is the costumes and scenery that really make this show. Even if you don't have kids, this show is a perfect way to spend an evening with friends and loved-ones.	5	5	Visual Masterpiece	Tg174
3	October 8, 2013	The Lion King was simply brilliant, costumes awesome, enjoyed every minute. Disappointed that people did not dress up to see the show.	35	5	Lion King	Ggablo
17	October 9, 2013	"This is an excellent production for all ages, and a great show for a young first timer expericencing Broadway. We got our tickets thru Ticketmaster, and I thought I was being very clever by obtaining aisle seats for a quick exit and I made sure everyone in my party knew I had secured such awesome seats. When we arrived we were surpised that my much discussed ""aisle seat"" had a steel railing at the end of it, preventing our quick escape. I had forgotten that a few of the acts come down the aisles and I am assuming this may have been there to prevent accidents. No worries though, we were still able to get out in a reasonable timeframe so it didn't really matter. The second floor lobby is remarkable at night with the lights of Times Square in the background. We exited the theatre thinking it was daytime as the lights were so illuminating! A beautiful theater and a wonderful show."	20	5	Can't go wrong here	shoesmith
75	October 9, 2013	The Lion King is a wonderful story set to magical music. No one does staging and costumes like Disney. Like Disneyland, the Lion King is a 360* experience. You are transported to a magical kingdom and immersed in suspended belief as the story of rebellious youth takes you through tragedy, love, and triumph. If you don't feel good coming out of this play--you either have no heart or you are a zombie.	34	5	Lion King--Disney hits all marks on this one	WaipahuTraveler
159	October 10, 2013	The play was so much better than what I had expected. The costumes were fantastic, and the music was great. Enjoyed every minute. A must see.	41	5	Awesome Musical	Chessie22
27	November 29, 2013	Awesome venue and awesome show. This was the first show I have seen on Broadway. Great time. The only bad thing was the show was only playing one night while we were there, so we had to buy tickets instead of gambling at TKTS. But, it was worth it to see the show.	5	5	Awesome	Michael A
157	December 1, 2013	"Saw this from the mezzanine. We were worried it would be terrible in the ""bad"" seats upstairs. I dare say no seat in this theater would be bad! The costumes were crazy good, the set is absolutely spectacular, and the actors put on a show. My one ""complaint"" is they allow food and drink into the theater. (Which would be ok if they sold candy in bags that didn't crinkle and cause background noise as kids eat! ) If you're going with children make sure you watch the DVD before going so they know the plot. They do ask for donations after the show for ""Broadway Cares"" - to go to their charity of choice. I'm not sure if this is only during the holidays, but we did not feel ""obligated"" to give. Plenty of patrons paraded past the donation sites and did not feel guilty about walking by. Enjoy the show, like so many others have! "	73	5	Pride Rock in NYC!	76543travel
21	December 7, 2013	"The entrance of the ""animals"" thru the room (not the stage) was incredible. The dancers make you feel like there are real animals. Beautiful, not just for children. The view of Times Square from the lobby was beautiful."	9	5	Incredible	Lorena V
101	December 11, 2013	The music, costumes and staging were so very good. We had an aisle seat in the orchestra section because the animals and other characters parade into the theater down the aisles--it was awesome. Would not mind seeing it a second time. Worth every penny for the orchestra/aisle seat.	89	5	Phenomenal!!	CajunCountryBR
21	December 16, 2013	Brilliant show, fantastic cast and costumes. Got a standing ovation. Staff show you to your seats which were very comfortable. No crowds or long queing. Enjoyed the whole experience.	18	5	Fantastic show	Tina W

8	December 23, 2013	This was the third time I have seen this show (1st time in NY) and I was very disappointed. The performers were OK and their voices did not project like I have seen before. We saw two other shows on the same trip, Newsies and Radi City Xmas Spectacular, and both were alot better and more enjoyable! Disappointed after spending $275/ticket!	4	3	Not the best version I have seen	Rick V

2	December 28, 2013	"Ok, wow, ummm, this is going to be hard to explain. Well, let me just give you a short summary of what I thought about the ""Lion King"" at The Minskoff Theater: Beautiful and Artistic! This show was just amazing from the costumes, the dancers, the emotion in the performers faces, and their hard work. This show is great for all ages. The dancers are so passionate about their jobs! I just love how everybody is working so hard to make such a great show! ""The Lion King"" is very easy to understand for young children. The story was clearly written for audiences of all ages. This is from an eleven-year old's perspective.     Hakuna Matata"	1	5	"""Mind Boggling!"""	mm m

222	January 3, 2014	the movie was better! i saw this when it first opened and i felt like i was watching a high school play. the sets were amateur and boring. costumes were way too simple. maybe i had high expectations, but i was very disappointed and couldn't wait to leave the theater	88	3	eh	lolo c
119	January 6, 2014	After good suggestions by friends, we (myself and part of my family) decided to book and see this show - all adults. It is amazing what they've done, the place (Minskoff Theatre) is also part of the show. The actors, sound, music, visual effects, it's all well done, no complaints, we had a great time. Must go and see.	47	5	Amazing!	Fernando_K_A
33	January 8, 2014	The show is excellent and not to be missed. The actors (musicians) were fabulous only to outdone by the costumes which were amazing. An adaptation not to be missed. This is what Disney brings to the theater. I repeat NOT to be missed.	14	5	Excellent Entertainment Choice	MrBull2013
142	January 13, 2014	If you go and see one show make sure this is the one you see. Superb entertainment from start to finish. The show has everything from special effects to a little bit of comedy with great acting. 	48	5	What a show	Mrfarandaway
138	January 17, 2014	It's worth seeing this show for the costumes! I especially liked the giraffes and the elephants. I'd suggest seating 1/2 way back in the center section. Both aisles are used for entrances so if you sit in the balcony or on the sides you miss the full effect. Also balcony right and left at the beginning of the show are used for musicians so if you sit too far back you can't see them. African drummers are located in balcony left throughout the show so if you are seated in main floor left seating you won't be able to see them at all. The only strong exceptional voice is that of the monkey. The other voices are good but not terrific. Box office was helpful in purchasing tickets. TKTS told us to date they've never received tickets for this show. However we were told sometimes ticket deals are available on line at the theater site. We did not find any deals for the dates we were available to attend. 	69	4	Fantastic costumes	2Finediners
78	January 20, 2014	I read all the views and really worried about getting the best show for the short time we were there. I'm so glad we chose the Lion King. Go through ticketmaster to get your tickets because the fees the other folks charge are ridiculous. I read other reviews about the theater...and I agree with them! I don't think there is really a bad seat in the house. But, we were in Orchestra Row O. Excellent choice. I'm glad I splurged on the more expensive tickets. And I would advise aisle seats if you can get them because the performers come down into the audience many times and it's AWESOME to be up close and see the details and hear their amazing voices. The theater is roomy, the seats are comfortable. It's true they only have a small women's bathroom - 5 stalls) and small concession stand. It's true the crinkling wrappers of people opening snacks is distracting but it's pretty cool that they allow snacks. The performance is beyond awesome. It's upbeat, it's moving, it's creative. I absolutely loved the character Rafiki. She was hilarious. It was wonderful for my kids to see children playing in roles...and those kids did a great job! And the transition of Simba from boy to man was so well done. The dancers are so fluid and graceful (watch the antelopes leap across stage) and the costumes are inventive (the giraffes are so impressive and the elephants so creative!). It's funny, too - listen to the hyenas and Timon and Pumbaa. Rafiki, though, as beautiful and graceful as so many of them are, is the one that stole the show for me. She was hilarious. We had a party of 5 people ranging from age 6 to 65 and we all loved it. Well worth the time and money.	79	5	Splurge! Go see this wonderful show!	lumic69
11	January 23, 2014	We went on the day of the performance and were told they only had seats on the very back row of the theatre in the corner. I was worried about if we would be able to see everything clearly, but the seats were fantastic, so much so that if I went again I would get these seats again as they were much cheaper. The performance was good and myself and my girlfriend both really enjoyed the show, the way the characters run through the audience really brings you into the performance. If you wanted to go I would get any seat available as I don't think there is a bad seat in the whole theatre.	10	4	Great show - back row of the theatre still fantastic view	mledg
34	January 23, 2014	Fabulous! Amazing! Awe Inspiring! Truly Magnificent. Have no doubt that you should spend the money and buy the tickets and see this show! It is exactly what a broadway show should be but probably what no show has ever achieved before. The costumes are absolutely gorgeous. The animals are portrayed with genius imagination. I never could have imagined a group of people on a stage could look so much like a herd of animals on the African Savannah. You will want to applaud (and probably will!) after each scene. 	46	5	Must See!!	charlottebelle67
50	January 23, 2014	We loved it: kids and adults alike loved this fab family fun!  We got seat in the first row: a must for the kids and the adults who still feel like they are kids! 	44	5	LIon is still KING!	cath049
252	January 24, 2014	Disney does it like nobody else. I couldn't fathom how they would have animals on stage via costume, but was very pleasantly surprised it was very creative and engaging, I loved it was so did my kids	58	5	What a fantastic show!	LongIslandGiirl

2	January 21, 2014	We were a group of eight people who had never seen Lion King Broadway show before but had watched the movie and listened to those delightful melodies from CD many times. We paid top $$$ for the tickets hoping and expecting to finally enjoy the famous Broadway show and fantastic live music just as in the Lion King movie and CD. However, we were totally dismayed to find out 99% of the music were African folk tunes which sounded like chanting mingled with shouting in a way without much pleasant melodies except for the first and the last songs in the show that sounded familiar to our ears, so to speak. As far as the stage sceneries, there was nothing astounding or anything spectacular to see. In many scenes, there were just blank stage, no effort was put into force on the stage sceneries whatsoever. In general, this is a mediocre Broadway show at best which does not deserve its famous reputation in my most humble opinion.	5	3	A complete disappointment, especially from the music perspective.	CutePug
40	January 21, 2014	I saw the touring show a few years ago in Boston which was absolutely amazing. But this time I went here for our anniversary and I was a little disappointed. Some of the characters were clearly not trying their best. Some of the singing was lazy from a couple actors and they performed like they really didn't want to be there. However the majority of the actors were great the select few who were had important roles which was disappointing. They didn't carry out their voices well and some parts were very rushed. =( 	16	3	Not their best 	CaitlinH300
14	January 22, 2014	Went to the Sunday matinee show and was blown away. Even though this is a kid's story at heart, the music, singing and dance performances were captivating. I watched the Lion King on tape with my kids as they were growing up and this performance sticks closely to the Disney Movie original. Loved revisiting the plot and characters. Highly recommended for kids and adults alike.	14	5	Great performance and great music	Josef G
35	January 22, 2014	The whole experience was amazing from start to finish. The actors were superb, the singing and costumes excellent. There are a wide variety of musicals to choose from on Broadway but I would recommend The Lion King.	27	5	Amazing Show	Deb S
2	January 18, 2014	I thought the lion king was absolutely brilliant, the theatre was packed and the cast received a standing ovation ,I would recommend this show 	1	5	Great night	Tracey T
57	January 19, 2014	The setup, costumes, actors... everything was just perfect! It's a classic you don't want to miss when visiting Broadway.	25	5	Awesome!	Huldi
14	January 19, 2014	Amazing show that I never saw until just recently. My 8 year old son loved the show as well! Performance and music had me spellbound from the moment the curtain rose. This was my first Broadway show and certainly am not an expert on this form of entertainment but I was moved. Ordinarily I would prefer a Knicks game at the Garden but for the Mrs. and my son I sprung for this and it was worth it!	9	5	Everything & More	Logicboy101
1716	January 20, 2014	Entertaining evening. Enjoyable music, the stage extends to actors out in the aisles of the audience. Fun and very colorful to watch. Recommended. 	748	4	Very Disney, you know the music score colorful production .	Journeyman644
128	January 13, 2014	The staging is still spectacular after all these years. But, after the two or three transcending songs the score trails off. I'd forgotten the acoustics were not as good as in the older theaters. It's just not Les Mis.	46	3	MIckey and Walt Will Hate Me	jettybetty
6	January 15, 2014	It was amazing how they worked with the puppets on set, as the animals were dancing around, it just worked out so well. The actors were amazing!	5	4	Great Production	iv_eternity
15	January 16, 2014	We saw the lion on a Sunday evening. The lion is fab! the costumes are brilliant and the singing is just fantastic! The theatre is lovely and has a great view of times square through the higher window. I would see this show every single week if I could!	21	5	Brilliant	kelly a
7	January 16, 2014	This was our first Broadway show and we absolutely loved it! We sat towards the back of the theater, but still had a great view. The costumes, music, sets were all amazing! The actors were extremely talented! We definitely got our money worth and are already ready for our next Broadway show!	8	5	Amazing show!	Lindsey D
11	January 8, 2014	"I was absolutely astounded at how very little I enjoyed this show -- after paying for premium seats, my husband and I walked out feeling like we had flushed $600 down the toilet. :( I am a lover of musicals, truly. We've seen other Broadway shows, we've been to the West End, we make sure to get top seats for every touring show that comes to our corner of Australia. I buy musical soundtracks and sing along in the car. It's not that the beauty of a good musical is lost on me, but goodness this one was terrible. First - it was boring. There were entire scenes that lost my interest enough that I was checking my watch. Oh, the shame! Example (because everyone wants one): the lionesses hunting. It was a lot of pretty average contemporary dancing, the caliber of which I have seen in high school dance recitals. Second - our little Simba wasn't great. I'd be more blunt with my opinion, but I don't like the idea of picking on a child. Suffice to say that in ""I Just Can't Wait to be King,"" little Nala carried the song in the bits she sang. Older Simba busted in to ""Hakuna Matata"" out of pitch. Astounding. Third - I personally (and I know others do not feel the same way) found the performer/puppet setup very...distracting. My eyes kept flitting back and forth between the puppet character and the performer who was actually singing/talking. They were not keeping their movements or expressions neutral, but mimicking those of the puppet, so it was hard to get used to looking at one or the other, not trying to look at both simultaneously. I did not like it. I would have much preferred the performers dressed up themselves, instead of being puppet-masters. Fourth - I thought the Minskoff Theatre was pretty boring, in terms of Broadway or West End theatres. The best Art Deco bits were unable to be appreciated in the swells of people (in the lobby/entrance areas), and the internal parts were drab and simplistic. It was quite a change from the Eugene O'Neill theatre, where we had been the night before. Anyway, in summary, it was such a huge disappointment. This was a movie I loved as a chid, the soundtrack was my first CD (!), and I had been waiting YEARS to see it. I just can't equate all of the glowing reviews with the show I experienced. :( To explain my two star rating, instead of one, the performer who played Scar, Gareth Saxe, was absolutely brilliant. Really. His scenes were the ones I found myself impressed by, and looking forward to, throughout the show. A wonderful performance by him for sure."	25	2	Disappointment plus	gingerhilpipre
14	January 9, 2014	First time to Broadway show but been to many shows before. Production was amazing. We had great seats 10 rows from front on the aisle and the animals parading a the start past our seats set the bar so high ... but the production moved that bar higher. The sun rise and sun set ... pure genius and the stampede of the wildebeest I have such admiration for those who have the vision to capture that on stage. Highly recommended with 11 year old, 16th year old and 18 year old as well as the parents.	4	5	Wow!	DublinNicki
4	January 10, 2014	This is the best show that I saw in my life, so creative and natural, really love it and be back again! the music is fantastic and the characters as well	3	5	Best show ever!	Berni_y_Andres
5	January 12, 2014	My husband and I went to the Lion King in October last year and it was only on seeing this is rated as the #3 attraction in NYC just now that I felt compelled to write a review for this to say I really don't understand or agree with this rating at all. There are so many attractions in NYC that would rate above this it's just not funny and on the whole we were disappointed with this show after all the hype and having always loved the movie. I have been to many shows over the years with Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera my favourites. Compared to the productions of these shows which I have seen in London, Melbourne and Toronto and other shows, the set of the Lion King was pretty underwhelming. I expected a more elaborate set depicting the desert and cliffs but the set was very basic and at times there was not a lot on the stage. This production requires you to use a lot of imagine.. At one point in the show the man playing Mufasa removes his mask all together so you just have to imagine the man on the stage as a lion! The most moving part of the movie - Mufasa's death felt rushed... Unlike other major shows I've seen I felt bored at times and didn't feel moved by or engaged with the story. The original animated movie was able to move me to tears but this show did not make me feel moved at all. This has been overated.	7	3	Dissapointing and definitely not the 3rd best attraction in NYC	lovetotravel567
202	January 6, 2014	". . . and what a wonderful first show to see! From the music to the effects to the lighting to the talented actors and actresses, ""The Lion King"" completely surpassed my already high expectations. I'm so thrilled that we chose to see this production; this is a story that reminds us of the beautiful ""Circle of Life"" and how lucky we are to be a part of it."	147	5	My First Broadway Show . . .

66	January 7, 2014	Took my seven-year-old (who had previously seen it in Vegas a couple of years ago) - not to be missed even the second time, each city seems to have a slight variation on the show, theatre was great.	30	5	Don't miss it.	travelaboutbear
42	January 7, 2014	I think everyone knows the film and the story of the Lion King. The show is just tremendous and this has to be one of the most beautiful Art Deco Theatres I have ever seen. They are both stunning!	38	5	A Fantastic Show in an AMAZING Theatre	mad4travel_01
14	January 7, 2014	It was a great show but where we bought the tickets on a site NYC was so expensive for where the seats were located.	10	4	Lion King - Broadway	BRM1960

86	January 5, 2014	We were amazed by it all: the costumes, the talented actors, the elaborate scenes, and the music. Our youngest two children (ages 7 and 9) loved it as much as the rest of the Family. It was an AWESOME show!	70	5	Great for the Young Kids	Nodaksx6
92	January 5, 2014	We loved the show, and it's one of the few that I would even consider seeing again. Minskoff theater is great. Row N seats were perfect. Kids 7 and 9 really enjoyed as well.	58	5	awesome show	John R

33	December 28, 2013	"was in the city for a short 3 night visit to see THE LION KING. I had seen the original when it opened years ago, but my partner had never seen a Broadway show. he is not fond of musicals, but I decided this was the perfect show for a ""live musical"" virgin. and when I saw the seat location I hit send immediately. the tickets are now so horrendously expensive, but in this case worth it. 8th row center section on the aisle. perfect!!! the show is still in great shape with wonderful performances, especially the young Simba, Rafiki, and grown Narla. it is visually and musically brilliant. staging is flawless...the opening still brings tears and cheers!  the only shame is the cost of all Broadway tickets today. we would have seen more but cant afford mediocre seat locations at overpriced prices. shame on Broadway for that. and now my partner wants to see more Musicals! that's the quality of THE LION KING."	28	5	THE KING still RULES!!!	waiting4corky
9	December 28, 2013	Sensational. We purchased cheap matinee tickets and were in the second last row from the back but it didnt matter. We were so mesmerised that we could have been seated in row 1. If I had time I would have booked straight away to see it again. Loved it loved it.	5	5	Fantastic	Trish H
83	December 29, 2013	"A great show! We were in the upper section, 3 rows from the back and it was still a great show for everyone in our family. Sound level was perfect... even when one of the mics went dead for a several minutes, we could hear perfectly. The actors were superb and unlike anything we've seen before. To go again, i would pay the extra for a better seat... but we had just arrived in the city and it was the only night we could see it, so we had to settle. Act 2 does seem a little over-drawn... and a couple songs don't seem to fit, but overall, a ""can't miss."""	63	5	EXCELLENT	Gray52
126	December 30, 2013	This show really is worth spending the money on!  After wanting to see it for years and years it didn't disappoint! The costumes and make up are amazing.  We was sat on the front row of the mezzanine and had an amazing view although for some reason it was freezing up there, everyone put their coats back on at the interval so maybe wear a chunky knit!	69	5	Amazing!

The show was well worth every single penny it costs us! From beginning till the end, we were all hooked. The opening number ""Circle of Life"" already made us tear up--it was that good! We used to wonder how they are going to include all the big animals in the Lion King movie; What we saw just blew us away....The giraffes, the elephants...amazing!!!"	79	5	Rrrroaring in joy!!	loujane14

78	December 17, 2013	I had goosebumps and tears! It was amazing. I had heard from many people that it was a good show. It came to Detroit and I missed it. I am so glad I saw it in the smaller, original theater, built for the show. This show is a MUST see. Put it on your list! 	24	5	Wish I could it 20 stars!	daystar40
14	December 17, 2013	Me and my boyfriend went to see this show we've seen wicked and a number of other shows but this by far was the best show we've ever seen the atmosphere was amazing the show on a whole was fantastic and I've recommended it to every one I've spoke to, was well worth the price and I would defiantly see it again. My boyfriend even sang along and for the rest of our trip. Also you get a fantastic view of Times Square from Inside the theatre which was a bonus. 	4	5	Amazing!! A must see	Annalou153
19	December 17, 2013	The actors did such a wonderful job portraying their characters as animals. We had a great view from the mezzanine. Glad we attended.	5	4	Exciting show	tjofgrn
58	December 18, 2013	The show was great but why do so many people pay a fortune to go to the theatre and spend all evening coughing, sneezing, talking or eating. Didnt spoil it for us but could put other folk right off. 	37	4	Suberb.....	foodtec

161	December 14, 2013	We saw this the first weekend in December and we loved the show. It was wonderful and it exceeded my expectations. I would recommend that you sit in the mezzanine sections so you can look down and see everything going on. The costumes were wonderfully made and the actors had beautiful voices. We really liked young Simba and Nala - they were great. The show followed the actual Disney movie, we were very pleased with that. The show is over 2 hours with a 15 mintue intermission. I will also caution everyone they are very serious about no pictures being taken - even heard them threaten to delete pictures off of the camera. I would recommend this for all ages but if taking small children remember the show is over 2 hours and they may not be able to sit still that long.	60	5	Best Broadway Show Ever	piercka1
87	December 15, 2013	On a recent break in New York, the wife and myself managed to get tickets for the Lion King. We had a fabulous time and as we never got to see the production in the west end of London, Broadway was the better location and thanks to first-class cast and crew the overall production was a joy to watch and it was a privilege to be there. All aspects of the show was faultless and it capped a good day in new York. I would recommend to anyone going there to get tickets for this show.	51	5	LION SHARE OF AUDIENCES	paul b

31	December 10, 2013	"Everybody knows the story by now, and everybody has heard part or all of the music before. But the ""mise en scène"" is really unbelievable and brings you in a different universe altogether, both visually (the animal costumes are incredible) and soundwise (some amazing singing here). Worth every penny (even if I got invited and don't have a clue what this show might cost). (I'm smiling again just remembering this wonderful performance, even if it was 7 weeks ago)"	9	5	"""flabbergasted"""	68RedRover
86	December 10, 2013	This show is one of the most sophisticated productions, lots of moving parts, complicated costumes and choreography. Everyone knows the story, so you pay more attention to the technical aspects. Pretty good overall, kids-friendly.	24	4	First-rate production	michael s
21	December 2, 2013	The costumes and set for this production were awesome. The music, of course, was also great. It was hard to believe the actor playing young Simba was only 10 years old - he was so good!	11	5	Impressive costumes	Maureen M
15	December 3, 2013	I'd never been to a Broadway show. Although really expensive, you are seeing great performers and great stage craft, it is worth every penny. 	19	5	Awesome Show!	scmtneer
43	December 5, 2013	"This must have been my fourth or fifth time seeing this show, but it was the top choice of my boyfriend for his first Broadway experience, so we ended up going to a matinee to see it. The show itself is wonderful, with some of the best (if not THE best), costumes on Broadway, crowd-pleasing songs and good pacing. The actors have changed some of the jokes since I last saw it a few years ago, so even though the story and most of the parts are familiar to me, it was still interesting. We ended up sitting in the third row of the mezzanine which, while not my preference, is a great seat. I tend to like the orchestra more because I feel more connected to the stage and everything seems larger and more impressive, but you're certainly not going to miss anything sitting in the mezzanine and for people who prefer it I would definitely recommend the seats. My boyfriend loved it and if he were reviewing it then he would probably give it a 5/5. My qualms were not at all to do with the production but with the general atmosphere of the theater. The matinee is - by virtue of being a matinee - more casual. It also has many families, and while the majority of them are well-behaved, some of them are not. We had the unfortunate luck of sitting in front of a small child who constantly asked her parents ""what is happening,"" kicked my seat, etc. I know that is not at all the fault of the theatre, but just keep in mind that sort of thing is more likely due to the atmosphere of a Sunday matinee.  My other complaint was the charity event that the cast was putting on as a part of the overall charity event that goes on around Broadway this time of year. I don't have any problem with charity, and I even wanted to donate money/purchase the special charity souvenirs, but it was horribly disorganized and frustrating. They basically set up a single table on the orchestra level, and everyone rushes in a mob to get there before everyone else. We waited in line for a while and then gave up after it became too frustrating. I support their charity efforts 100% but they could set up another table and make an effort at better organization.  I would, overall, truly recommend this show. I would recommend, however, that unless you're traveling with a family yourself, to try to make it to the evening show. The atmosphere is usually marginally more formal and more appropriate for couples/adults."	35	4	Still Great	zambixi
42	December 6, 2013	My first broadway theatre I did find the tickets and the food and souvenirs expensive Great show for kids A brillant display off special effects A great show for kids Not many great songs though A spacious theatre Well worth going too	22	5	Brillant show	Elaine B
61	November 29, 2013	This show was on my daughter's list for 5 years and I could never find a way to buy discount tickets. Finally sprung for Orchestra seats at full price and it was worth every penny!  Most people are probably familiar with the story and the songs, thanks to the Disney movie. However the costumes and the sets are so creatively done and the scenery changes so clever that it's just amazing to experience the show as a theatre production. I highly recommend this show to anyone of any age.	29	5	Dazzling show	bostonienne
106	November 30, 2013	This was a great show, and I was expecting one so it was good they lived up to it, the best part that I didn't expect were the costumes. This is a must see, my daughter has decided we must go back and see it again!	35	5	Incredible show! Costumes are amazing	SharaAbra
58	November 30, 2013	We recently saw the Lion King for Thanksgiving. As for the show, we enjoyed it, puppets were outstanding, music and dancing were good but to be perfectly honest we were not impressed. We could not put our finger on it but we left the theater with a somewhat empty feeling. We expected a lot. From family and friends to reviews we thought this was going to be it for a play. We really don't know. This wasn't our first play or theater experience. Again, the show was good but we were not blown away. May be because it deviated from the movie but that is to be expected. Just not sure.  It seemed like an overpriced Disney Production. I am sure through the years artist creativity has made some changes but again I don't now. One thing that really bothered us was the price. Yeah you pay more for the holiday but $10 for a Coke and water. Then the employee behind the counter yells to everyone to know what you want and that they accept tips. Was that really necessary. You pay for Tickets, over priced drinks, asking for donations, pushing memorabilia for charity and then asking for tips. They don't bother to  tell you that. You are paying for a collectible cup. My wife and I hardly needed one. Also in the end they asked for money for charities. Made you feel guilt ridden. On top of that, they herded everyone out the door as quickly as possible. Worst of all, my wife is 7 months pregnant and just as we were about to leave, needed to use the restroom. They shut off the escalators and the bathrooms. She climbed al the way to the top of the steps. Not a short climb. They refused to open the bathroom door and told her to go across the street to the Mariott and use theirs. Wow. She is obviously pregnant. Very bad pr and Disney is supposed to pride themselves on that.  Good show just dissatisfied.	27	4	Not blown away	Ron A
13	December 1, 2013	"I say it like it is... I was in New York for four days, as part of a longer trip which included Washington. On my list of 'things to do' was see a show on Broadway - Lion King was the chosen show (mainly due to the reviews and the 'build up'). Let me say this, when you get to NY you will walk and shop like never before! It is fast paced. Then you will go get changed, have something to eat, go see a show - If that show is not the absolute best, you will get distracted and fall asleep. If you have seen the Disney film, you have 'peaked' the show is nowhere near as good as the film (just managing expectations) - it is full of American humour, which, frankly is not that funny. On balance, the costumes were good. If time is of the essence, go do something else with your time! I can now say ""I have seen a show on Broadway"" the next question will be ""did you enjoy it?"" - ""nope, would rather have slept in preparation for next day!"" About me and the trip - I had a list of things to do in NY, I wanted to get as much squeezed in to my time there, that time would have been best spent doing something else!

39	February 21, 2014	Disclaimer: Spoilers ahead.  I will start with the negative: I enjoyed this musical, but I have to agree with some of the reviews about the puppet thing. I don't know why they could not create a costume for certain characters, i.e. Timone. The character of the baboon, Rafiki, I did not enjoy, but it was just me. I found the interpretation to be annoying, but it actually got the most laughs from the audience and children seemed to really like the interpretation.  The positive:  Great music and the singers were talented. The young Simba and Nala were so young yet so talented. The stage and the dances were amazing. Colors, music, talent, all came together to make a great show. Even with the negatives, it is still a great show and there is a reason it is still on broadway. 	17	4	Entertaining	Elle L
14	February 26, 2014	Amazing the whole show was brilliant, funny and sad! This was my first show on Broadway and I will now be trying others!	10	5	Amazing	Clon8484
22	March 3, 2014	Enjoyed the music and the crazy talent the dancers and actors had to bring the animals to life on stage. Definitely recommend!	2	4	Awesome Night	Kelsey M
223	March 6, 2014	Best show I have seen for years, great show, great play from the actors. The costumes are amazing, songs so well played, great experience overall	74	5	What a show	Christophe M
59	March 11, 2014	It really exceeded all the high expectations I had. The casting is great, the songs, the stage&props. It's all spot on! Definitely would return.	32	5	MAGNIFICENT	prosalesf
4	March 15, 2014	Very good show! The actors were top quality. The costumes really were the stars of the show. Just brought the animals to life! 	1	5	Granddaughter loved it	lemuel48
18	March 23, 2014	I went on my own to see the show as the rest of my party were too tired and I am so glad I did the effects were just amazing and will stay with me for ever	19	5	Brilliant show	AnnMarie53
38	March 27, 2014	Buy tickets from the theatre in the morning - they seemed much cheaper than the ticket office in Times Square.	15	5	Don't miss it.	EdinburghSightseer
50	March 30, 2014	This was the highlight of our NYC trip! We took a bicycle 'cab' to the theater and had aisle seats in row B. We purchased our tickets well in advance to get primo seats. If you have a child, you want him/her to sit on the aisle and down front because the characters use the aisle frequently to enter the stage. The costumes were amazing and the story is pretty much identical to the movie. It was a GREAT experience and a must if you have children!!!!!!	43	5	FABULOUS! A MUST!	Travelgo68
5	April 3, 2014	Spectacular! The puppetry was amazing and the actors were great! Followed the movie pretty good with a couple ad libs thrown in. Loved It	2	5	The Lion King	Francie M
23	April 4, 2014	Must do! This musical was amazing and if you go NEw york you must watch it. Its an experience. The prices for the musical were really expensive. Around 300 US for two people, but I never saw discounts for lion king. its a popular musical!	7	5	Must do!	Travel-Freaks-1988
27	April 6, 2014	It was really impressive when all animals get together in the very beginning of the show. It felt I was in a middle of a savanna.	2	4	Spectacular	Rogerio C
25	April 7, 2014	1st time seeing the lion king early March 2014 One of the best experiences during 4 weeks in the United states, From the costumes to the actors to the audience everything was perfect The young boy and girl playing Simba and Nala were fantastic. Well done to all involved.	21	5	amazeballs	RIPCITY36
84	April 7, 2014	We got tickets as a birthday gift to my son and I loved every second of it! Beautiful! I was surprised at how good the younger actors were every scene got a roaring round of applause my 6 year old loved it! Please after the show if you can donate to broadway cares it's for a really good cause please do so :)! My only complaint is I spent 4 dollars on a bag of pretzels	40	5	A must see	Carlanmcd
102	March 30, 2014	Sets, music, performance, great for any age. We took our eight year old granddaughter and we all loved it.	35	5	It has everything...	Michaeli01
12	March 31, 2014	First time for me to any Broadway play as it's not my calling. The theatre was fairly clean, folks were helpful, and lit up well. The stage folks behind the scenes did an awesome job. I agree with some previous comments about how difficult it was to understand what the entertainers were saying, especially while singing? Had a few knucklehead juveniles kicking my seat, and that's always comforting. No respect, especially when you're paying $165 a ticket.  On that note, drinks were stupid expensive at $13 for a rum-coke at intermission. WOW!  I thought Disney was a rip-off, but I guess this show is produced by them so there you have it. High notes: the people were energetic, passionate, and put on a good show. Low notes: in my opinion $165 is too much for this ticket. I think a Cirque show is more entertaining. To top it off I think it's rude to have the performers take a bow at the end of the night, and then ask for more money for cancer, or anything else. I felt like I was in a catholic church at donation time! really! How about using that $26 dollars I just gave the bar to donate for the cause.	2	4	weekend in manhattan	marcel c
129	March 31, 2014	I have seen many Broadway shows. I have to say this was one of the best. The costumes and scenery are phenomenal. The singing was terrific. This is a play ou do not want to miss. You will be sorry!	96	5	A play that you will always remember!	Donnalynn323
9	April 2, 2014	Lion King is such a great story I would never get bored of it! The music and costumes were simply amazing!	2	4	Awesome First Broadway Experience!	Diana T
15	March 27, 2014	Excellent musical, very colorful and songs are wonderful. Loved the children at the presentation. Strongly recommend it.	7	5	Beautiful!	Juliana S
6	March 27, 2014	The Lion King was by far the best show that I've ever seen. I cried twice! I would watch it over and again if I lived in New York!!	1	5	Best of All	Von C
26	March 29, 2014	We were not sure which show to see, settled on the lion king, so glad we did! We got good seats, middle front, could see everything and the singing and acting/dancing was amazing. At the interval there was a long queue for the ladies, so be careful not to miss the show start and the soft drinks came in cool plastic cups, which we kept! Fab show, a must see whilst in New York! 	32	5	Amazing show!	Katb21
22	March 29, 2014	The costumes for the show were brilliant and lovingly detailed, worth seeing for this alone! The show had a lot of energy, although I probably still prefer the movie...	15	4	Amazing costumes	DeeDubs114
16	March 24, 2014	As I had heard a lot of good things about this show (and I love the animated version) I convinced my husband to get the tickets to go see it last September. The theater is smaller than I expected, so to me it looked a bit overcrowded at times. Music and coreography were really engaging, and the actors were very talented! I personally wasn't impressed with the kid you was impersonating young Simba, that is why I gave it four stars, his perfomance could not be compared to the others', but maybe we simply caught him on a off-night. I would strongly recommend it!	8	4	Not entirely what I expected	Alice_W85
82	March 26, 2014	Well where do I start. I took 5 to this and I sat off to the side. This is worth spending the extra $50 to be in the middle of the stage. The costumes and the singing were excellent. the monkey character Rafik was the only one that people did not relate too?? Not sure why, maybe that costume needs more work. Tail and ears?? The main songs were enjoyable. Acting was superb.	30	5	Big Disney Production, doesn't disappoint	WRS0
20	March 26, 2014	I always dreamed of bringing my daughter to this show when she was little. I'm so happy that she is now 19 and only now i was able to bring her to NY and it is still running. It is more than what you can expect, is just AMAZING!	12	5	No wonder it's still running	Damaris R
239	March 26, 2014	Are we the only ones who did not think this show was fabulous? We thought it more suitable for a younger age group. The costumes and props of the production are outstanding.	74	3	Disappointing for us	Anonymous255068
125	March 16, 2014	We were lucky enough to get last minute tickets and were not disappointed. It was a beautiful experience. The opening scene was so colorful, visual and auditorily amazing, filling every sense pleasantly. The actors were all magnificent. We were open mouthed by the way the animals were portrayed and the skill of the movement among the actors/dancers. The music was down right spiritual.	61	5	Beautiful!	PsItravel
656	March 16, 2014	I can see why this is rated as the number one attraction, as it was just a delight. So well done with talented professionals. The costuming and set design were fabulous. I don't want to give it away so I won't write specifics about the opening of act one, but it had me smiling wide with enjoyment and surprise. I had thought that it was a musical more geared for children, but it definitely has a universal appeal for all ages. Highly recommend.	202	5	Exceeded all expectations	Sandy N
98	March 19, 2014	Growing up with The Lion King as my all time favourite movie (and still is) I was so excited to finally get to experience it on Broadway and in New York! It left me speechless! No words can describe just how amazing it was! I did pay extra to have really good seats in the second row but I think if you were seated anywhere throughout the theater it would of been just as magical.  The actors in it were brilliant! I cannot fault anything! You cannot take food or drink into the theater as with most places but they do check your bags here. Bottled water is allowed.  I would highly recommend seeing The Lion King when in New York it was amazing and was defiantly one of the highlights of my holiday.	49	5	SPEECHLESS!	Shara May L
15	March 20, 2014	Best musical I have seen. The music was great and the way they made the animals come to life was fantastic. If you go try and get a seat next to the aisle on ground level. 	2	5	Amazing	lulabelladaisy
11	March 11, 2014	Loved the production, especially that the characters came down the aisles through the audience more than once and used the whole theater space. The costumes were outstanding and so creative - the story was told and understood through the music and the characters and the animation of everything from the grass on the savannah to the stampede of the wildebeests through a canyon.  My biggest complaint is the price of the concessions - I get it that things may be a little higher priced, but the costs of soft drinks and wine were astronomical!! Why gouge the theater goer for that when ticket prices are already so high!	2	5	Amazing!	ceedah59
14	March 11, 2014	this show was amazing! its got the most intircit and well designened costumes and set. its mind blowing. the story is right on track to the movie. and the singers are wonderful! itws deffiantly a must seeeeee!! 	6	5	Amazing!	skimbo2002
4	March 12, 2014	Loved the costumes, the music and the performances! It's worth it to pay a bit extra to be up close and literally surrounded by animals during some of the scenes!	1	5	Visually stunning	heavyd1171
31	March 13, 2014	Went to see this with my family for a special occasion & it was fab, even better than we were all expecting. I am a die-hard Lion King fan as I grew up watching the movie & I just loved it! Very well done, especially Rafiki - she was amazing! Great experience for couples, friend, families, old or young. Well worth going & highly reccomended. 	88	5	Amazing from start to finish	89KB89
11	March 7, 2014	Go and see it!  We had front row seats in the balcony which were great! Loved how the animals came through the audience at the beginning. 	4	4	Amazing	gina130284
25	March 8, 2014	This was the highlight of our NYC trip! This was our first broadway show experience, despite seeing many musicals in Londons west end, but this just beats them all! I cried four times, as it was absolutely breathtaking. Suitable for all ages, and a must if you're in New York!	11	5	Outstanding!	keli1991
13	March 9, 2014	I've been looking forward for this show for a long time because of all the advertising. I love Disney and I love The Lion King... but I guess that's why I was a little bit disappointed in it. The actors are amazing but I just wanted to hear the movie version of the songs. Oh well, it was still a great show that I would recommend for everyone to see. Scar was great! I recommend to pick seats close to the aisles since the actors do walk up and down the aisles at some point.	17	4	I expected more though...	QueenOfShiba
68	March 10, 2014	Got great aisle seats for the Lion King. A very comfortable theatre and the show itself was very cleverly done. Everyone Lin the audience really enjoyed the show and of course the kids were really excited by it. Well worth the price of admission	30	5	Really enjoyed it	gghorse
7	March 4, 2014	I have only been waiting about 4 years to see this play. I took my nieces to see it. The costumes were fabulous. The acting and singing rousing and exciting. If you can manage it, get aisle seats. The actors in costume come down the aisles at various times in the play. My nieces loved it. 	15	5	Loved it	sablewolf
2	March 4, 2014	I needed a play that would suit the entire family. My 13 year old son is not that into shows and he loved The Lion King. The stage and costumes will take your breathe away.	3	5	Loved it	Kathy S
15	March 5, 2014	There are no words to express the pure enjoyment of watching the Lion King on Broadway- it was worth every second!	1	5	AWESOME!	stacy7795
43	March 5, 2014	Unbelievable costumes with people operating half animals...great story and music....see 'em all! Nothing to dislike about this one...	24	5	Costumes!	chas1133
10	February 27, 2014	This was a fantastic show, the young girl and boy were amazing and only 10 years old. Worth every penny and the seats we had were really good. Actors and actresses come out onto the ground floor so worth while paying that wee bit extra to feel more part of it.	3	5	Excellent!	hannigan23
26	March 1, 2014	Lion King is a classical and it was performed in a beautiful way. The theatre was comfort and nice. prices were bit too high imo, but i don't really have anything to compare to :)	20	5	beautiful show	Avi T
106	March 2, 2014	The show was an average evening out. The costumes and the show was fanciful but I lacked some blockbuster songs. Overall,not a masterpiece, just a fine musical.	41	3	Ok musical	Eric U
20	March 2, 2014	The show really was breath-taking! Awesome cast, scenery and wooah those voices of the young singers! I'd love to go again when visiting NYC next time	10	5	amazing!!!!	martsaa
2	February 22, 2014	Music is great, actors and actresses are presented livelihood of lion life! It is good for children to watch, even the younger one can sit stand and finish the show.	64	4	Great show	GreenieGeeen
43	February 23, 2014	As good as people say. It is amazing how they create the animals. Brilliant songs too, of course. Well worth it - a fantastic show	25	5	Amazing	Ruth W
17	February 23, 2014	Best play ever. Lots of beautiful costume changes. Music excellent. A must see. Actors knew there parts. Great seats all over the theater. 	12	5	Wonderful show	Redalert35
15	February 25, 2014	I had never seen the movie (the lion king) so I was not sure what to expect. Overall I was very pleased withe the production. If I had one negative cement it would be that certain parts seemed to drag. The costuming was amazing. 	3	4	Good show	Scott M
67	February 19, 2014	We shared this experience with younger nieces -- sit them in the aisle seats and watch their faces and characters come up and down the aisles. Well organized smooth performance -- a bit scary for a younger child. Come early enough to enjoy the scenes through the window of Times Square all lit up as well as photo ops with elements in the lobby. Souveniers were worthy of the prices and there was a nice assortment. Room was really warm, but no one could have expected that kind of warm weather in December. Several patrons were quite late and they were seated during the performance which was a bit disruptive, but at those ticket prices I can't imagine turning someone away. Rumors abounded that this is the last we will see of the Lion King soon on Broadway, so I am glad we didn't miss it.	17	4	Great costumes, beautiful production!	LoriSLewisburg
22	February 19, 2014	The theatricals of this performance just made me speechless. The details in the costumes where just fantastic and so lifelike. As a fan of the lion king I felt amazed at how my favourite childhood movie, on stage could still make me feel like singing, dancing, crying and laughing along with all the characters. Must see for all. 	7	5	Breathtaking!	Meghan M
18	February 20, 2014	My title says it all, i really can not put into words how amazing the Lion King really was.  Costumes ,staging, singing, dancing everything was perfect.  I booked our tickets through ticket master June/July 2013 when the tickets were first released, and could pick any seats i wanted. Have previously sat in the orchestra 5/6 rows from the front for mary poppins at the new amsterdam theatre so went for pretty much the same seats at the minskoff theatre.  The experience being right in the heart of the action is jaw dropping and being able to see the smaller details on the stage is amazing. Defiantly didn't think twice about booking the seats, as it was worth every penny.  Hardest part was keeping it a secret from my boyfriend until christmas day :)  The theatre was pretty packed when we arrived but had conformation ready to pick up our tickets, have it ready with id, people behind the desk were quite grumpy and not very patient with other guests while we were queuing.  Views of Times Square are fantastic once you are inside, also a small gift/souviner shop, but did notice a lot of the apparel was for sale at the Disney Store across the street, so not very exclusive.  Bar open for drinks and snacks are quite expensive but as expected.  Seem a tad strict on taking photos, can completely understand through the show no video/photography fair enough, but before/after the show we weren't even allowed to take photos of one and another or of the curtain covering the stage, without an attendant shouting at you.  Can not give enough credit to the actors/actresses who very fantastic and really did bring the character to life.  Defiantly A New York Must Do!!!	21	5	words can not describe how amazing it is!	KimF2708
46	February 21, 2014	I first saw this show in Los angeles before it ever went to Broadway. I remember it as being wonderful. Well, all of the elements that make it wonderful are still there but either me or the show seems to be getting a little dog eared. None the less it is well worth seeing.	20	4	Long running musical based on disney movie	panamamover
36	February 16, 2014	The staging, costuming and choreography left me absolutely amazed. The first act was simply fascinating, but the second act was a little weak	27	4	Disney puts on a good show.	cbass60668
15	February 16, 2014	"This was our second visit to the performance. First time was three years ago with friends, tonight it was Mom, Dad, and our ""little man"". The performance was an OMG hit. The critic of the family sat mouth wide open and all smiles the entire night. The entrance, the music, the costumes, the story, and simply the entire show made our Valentine's weekend in NYC perfect. After our first visit, we chose seats to give our ""little man"" the experience. We sat center orchestra, 5 rows back, and give the the aisle seat to our son. Amazing what you can literally feel. To look into the eyes of the performers and make that contact, you feel as though they are singing just to you. The true test of a show is the respect of the audience, and this cast commanded it from the start. Silence during and applause at each chance. I don't know who smiled more, the audience, or the performers. Don't look at the price of the ticket, the value is pure, the stage setting, truth to the story, and costumes alone are worth the price of admission......then they perform. You will not be disappointed. ENJOY"	8	5	Perfect For All Ages	Jeffery S
8	February 18, 2014	A must watch for all! Don't miss out on this musical extravaganza! You will never see anything like this!  A really good musical for younger children and cleverly performed to keep everyone fully entertained!  The costumes and staging is the best I've ever seen!	4	5	A Family Favourite!	TravellerRach2014
145	February 18, 2014	We recently saw the Lion King on Broadway. The performance was incredible. The music, costuming, and acting were all well worth the price of admission. You will be singing the songs for days and talking about the presentation of the story to anyone who will listen. It's an excellent way to spend the day with friends or loved ones and an experience I highly recommend. We were seated in row N, seats 118 - 120 (basically the center of the theater) and felt that we had an excellent vantage point. However, I found myself thinking that there wasn't a bad seat in the house. There is so much going on all around you that there is no one seat or section I would say was best. In a word, Go.	162	5	Fantastic	soul_surfer
16	February 10, 2014	Amazing. Went for my sons 16th birthday. Breathtaking in every way. 16, 19 30something and 40yr old all equally spellbound. How they bring parts of the film to life on Broadway is fantastic! More expensive of the musicals but definitely worth every penny 	11	5	Birthday trip	Nicolar123
100	February 11, 2014	I expected the show to be far more spectacular. After all, it's the Lion King and the music itself is fantastic. I was disappointed. The costumes and set design were not what I hoped for in a Broadway production. It was a step above a college performance. We paid full fare on our tickets and I wish we had seen another show. 	77	3	Great for Children but not for Adults	AnAdventureAddict
26	February 12, 2014	The show was stunning from beginning to the. Great music, great performance and great final. The time just flew. The location is rigth at the Times Square, with the best windowview in the hall.  Definately the best Broadway show.	19	5	Emotional	Helge G
3	February 13, 2014	If you are going to New York, watching `The Lion King' should be on a `Must To Do' list. I loved everything about it !! Outstanding and very entertaining ! Without a doubt one of the most fantastic things I have been to. Thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it !! Highly recommend going.	16	5	What a show !	Beth_R83
169	February 5, 2014	Our first Broadway show and it was fantastic. Great sets and fantastic performances. We had a great time.	14	5	Just Super...	Navtej G
6	February 6, 2014	Without a doubt one of the most fantastic things I have been to. Absolutely outstanding and very entertaining for all the family! Thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it!	6	5	Fantastic	framec13
11	February 6, 2014	My husband, myself, and another couple chose this to be #2 Broadway show to see while in NY for a long weekend. We chose this because it was #2 in reviews and ratings. Although there were lots of children there, this show is also great for adults too. Jersey Boys was #1, and this would be our #2 pick, although if you have children, this should be your show.  It is just hard to put into words the way they incorporated humans into animals that seemed to move so stealthy across the stage. Each costume is a genius piece of art, that probably took weeks to create each one. Not to mention how they all stood upright and did not collide into each other. The acting and singing was great - even with the little girl and boy. My personal favorites waere the giraffes and Timon.	5	5	Amazingly Artful	Michelle L
7	February 7, 2014	Wouldn't be a theater goer but loved this show. From start to finish it was excellent. Just as a tourist make sure when ordering drinks you specify if you want a Lion King cup or not or else prepare to be ripped off!! 	4	5	Love it	Gavin P
3	February 1, 2014	my sister has told me she has seen this play 4 times and i thought she was crazy. i can DEFINITELY understand why she can see it so much. it is an amazing show! must see it when visiting nyc	2	5	A MUST SEE!!!	Lawrence J
95	February 1, 2014	What a show it is the best musical ever and if you are going to see it do in style....on Broadway. Met some great people in line and sitting next to me travellers are all so friendly. The theatre is lovely and the seats comfortable, I felt I was transported to Africa from the opening note!	28	5	I was on Broadway!	54clare
121	February 2, 2014	Nice venue. I was told that the costumes were great, and they really were but the play was only okay. The singing was just only singing, I didn't get the emotion. Sorry, but the play and music are no comparison to Phantom. I was disappointed, as was my husband.	52	3	It was nice	chillynv
39	February 3, 2014	I'd heard so much about The Lion King, so I was looking forward to going. I will admit, it was very stylised and clever, but didn't float my boat. The music and acting were great, but it just didn't appeal to me.	6	3	Didn't live up to the hype	Carolyn O
380	January 28, 2014	We took my Daughter, Son-in-law and two grandchildren, ages 9 & 7 to a Saturday matinee. Sat in first row center mezzanine. Everything was amazing. These were exceptionally good seats for the kids as they were able to see the entire show with no obstructions. The costumes, sets actors were all wonderful. Highly recommend this show. I do agree with the others that the ticket prices were a bit high.	152	5	Unbelievable!!!!!!	spoiledrotten1
360	January 28, 2014	"One of our favorite shows. Amazing music and choreography. An absolutely ""must see"".  A show to be seen at all ages."	589	5	Extraordinary	Bills2018
266	January 29, 2014	This is a wonderful show for children of all ages. The costumes, settings and music are all terrific Enjoy!	134	5	Still Gret After All these Years	passionate-gardener
82	January 30, 2014	Brought students grades 3-12. Everyone loved it. Amazing costumes! Great characters and actors. Teaches diversity. This is my second time seeing. Just as good as last time in 2006. I highly recommend it	28	5	Great show!	Rebecca G
12	January 26, 2014	The show was fabulous. I have seen it in Pittsburgh, and also the abbreviated version at Disney's Animal Kingdom, but it has been a few years and this was a beautiful reminder of just how amazing this show really is. The caliber of the costumes and the technicality of the performers in bringing the animals to life are outstanding! We were in the second row so we had a unique opportunity to really see an up close view of each performer and it was truly captivating. You forgot there were humans under the makeup. I felt the show was simply amazing and I was glad I got to see it again.	2	5	The Lion King is still the King!	JOHNNA Y
22	January 27, 2014	Show is fantastic for all ages. We sat in row E seats 7-11. Not the best seats for the price paid as you didn't have the full view of the stage. Sitting in the centre towards the middle would have been better	8	5	Fantastic	Frasar159
13	January 27, 2014	It is definitely expensive, but so worth it! The costumes are beautiful, and the actors sing so well! Great idea for a family night! Also, we bought the tickets and the program online and got a free bag.	4	5	SO BEAUTIFUL	juliahorita
10	January 27, 2014	Excellent theatre and wonderful performance!!!!! Would recommend!! Nothing that I disliked. Price was bit high but to be expected in NYC! 	1	5	Amazing!!	ChelleWilks24
105	April 7, 2014	We watched the saturday night showing with our two children aged 10 and 7. It was Fantastic the effects were superb and it was worth the eye watering cost of the tickets! I would go so far to say it was the best production we have seen.	59	5	A roaring night out	familyD10
115	April 15, 2014	This is a great show for adults and kids. One of the best parts in the animals parading down the aisles of the orchestra. Good music. Good acting. Fun for everyone.	75	5	The Lion King	Kathi H
28	April 17, 2014	The costumes were fantastic and the movement of the 'animals' was very life like, the songs were well known and performed with gutso and went down very well with the audience. We were in row C (3 from the front) and you had to look up all the time and some of the action on the floor you could not see, I would suggest rows H and back or the dress circle.	13	4	Good atmosphere and great costumes	seansw19
53	April 22, 2014	Lion King was an absolute delight,the smile never left my face the whole performance. An absolute must for anyone visiting New York.	62	5	Fantastic	Gadabout2210
10	April 28, 2014	Absolute must see! Incredible! Everything about the performance was magical. A definite on the list of anyone visiting NYC	11	5	INCREDIBLE	paulbobsquarepants
12	May 3, 2014	Spectacular costumes and set design, incredibly moving story and music, wonderful actiing, dance/movement and singing. Exceeds all expectations. Brought family and friends for special occasions (five times)!	4	5	The Lion King - Favorite Play of All Time!	WestVillager17
27	May 7, 2014	What an amazing experience! A few things I would do different though. 1. I would book an evening show, we went matinee. We had 2 families in the row behind us that each had a child under 2 1/2. Both infants interrupted the show many times crying or yelling. 2. It doesn't show very well on the theatre maps but the first 10 or so rows in the balcony are much closer to the stage than rows on the main floor, we were in row Y. I went upstairs at intermission and spoke with and usher and she agreed that the first many rows up there are better than the back half of the orchestra section and usually cost less as well. 3. If you go, please don't buy food to eat during the show, we had that as well and it was extremely noisy.	29	5	Wow just wow	Burgman50
49	May 8, 2014	I watched Lion King as a kid. Forgot what happens in the second half of the story. I really don't like musicals in general and have never enjoyed watching one but this would be the first and probably only one. This is worth the money you pay for the tickets. Amazing costumes and set design. Very creative. make sure to get some snacks to eat at the show because everything is super expensive during intermission!	22	5	I hate musicals but LOVED this one	NZTRAVEL2014
35	May 13, 2014	We completely enjoyed watching The Lion King. The Minskoff is a fabulous theatre and we got good seats (high up in the gallery, almost in the center of the row). The stage is beautifully set up and the transitions in between scenes and acts were wonderfully done. Needless to say, the music and acting overall were of a very high quality. This is a great watch even if you've seen the movie a dozen times on television. The costumes, the make-up, the props were all very innovatively done. Viewing this on stage and watching the characters come alive right in front of you is a fantastic experience.	20	5	Great entertainment!	SP0714
90	May 15, 2014	I have seen the Lion King once in other States and twice in NYC. IT NEVER gets old. It is one of the best visual productions broadway has ever done. Everyone that I have attended the show with, young, old and non-broadway types leave the show amazed and wowed. If you only have one show to see in NYC especially if you are with kids or a first time theater goer this show is the one to see. Love it love it.	37	5	The most memorable production on Broadway	Betty M
77	May 19, 2014	What better place to see the Lion King musical than on Broadway. I loved the movie and I loved this production. The set is amazing and the costumes were fantastic. I liked that the storyline varied a little from the original movie and I also liked the immersive experience of the production that occurred with some of the cast being amongst the crowd. The opening and closing scenes were spine tingling. This is a well produced, well choreographed production. Staff were friendly. Gift shops and toilets plentiful. This was a fabulous experience.	32	4	Great show	Sarah B
11	May 27, 2014	Conveniently located in the theatre district of NYC, the Minskoff Theatre was a great venue to view the amazing Lion King. Everything was great from the cast to the wonderful stage set. 	6	5	Lion King is amazing!	Warmerdaysahead
33	May 28, 2014	I first saw this show years ago in another state and was amazed how good it was. Creativity, costumes, acting, music, decorations, etc, etc- the whole production was A+. A must see performance for any age group.	221	5	Excellent!	Elua7
52	May 28, 2014	Living in New York, I have seen The Lion King a few times, and I would not hesitate seeing it again! The magic of Broadway at its best. The spectacle, the creativity, the innovation, the music, the sheer talent of all people involved in the production is palpable at every moment. It will make you cry with wonder, and it will make you smile. I recommend it to everyone. Pure magic.	53	5	Still the King of all Broadway shows!	DomusLulu
84	May 31, 2014	The theater is tiny and next time I will probably get a seat closer to the front.  The performance was brilliant! As you watch, you will think of all the people in your life who would enjoy it. Especially the kids!!!!	126	5	A must see...	NativeNYorker
12	June 4, 2014	What a fantastic show. We had a great night. this show is a must for families visiting New York. Only small quible is the prices at the bar, a lot more expensive than regular nNew York bars.	5	5	Lion King New York	WillieM2002
544	June 7, 2014	The lion king did not let me down. I heard so many good things about it and finally got a chance to see it. Great storytelling, very easy to understand even people who English are not their first language. Amazing production; I am still amazed until today how delicate those giraffes were!!! Young Simba and Nara were just adorable. Highly recommended even you are grown-up. 	195	4	Landmark show	TheNayzer
146	June 7, 2014	If you were born around 1990 like me, Simba was definitely part of your childhood and this show will touch you like no other :) so beautiful. And I dont think having excellent english skills is essential to get the message.	61	5	Best show ever	Marina L
104	June 8, 2014	Saw the Lion King for my daughter's 16th birthday. We loved it!! SHe loved her! Her friend loved it! Amazing show! Amazing cast.  We finally saw this show all these years it is on Broadway, wish we had gone sooner! We had excellent seats, cast was wonderful. Pretty much word for word from the movie. Thought cast members holding up animals would be silly, but it works ! and it is a great show! Deserving of every award! LOVED IT!!! If you think this will only appeal to children, you are wrong. Wonderful story line, songs are so catchy, and upbeat! Got to say Hakuna Makada!  Go see it! If you have kids they will be singing and dancing!	90	5	Finally saw this award winning show! Amazing! have to see show!	deelovesdis
4	June 8, 2014	We LOVED this! It was the highlight of our vacation. The costumes, the singers, the scenery, the music, and more all came together for a fantastic experience.	114	5	Outstanding	Norman W
127	June 10, 2014	The costumes were out of this world, the cast had wonderful voices and the acting was great. I could not fault this in anyway shape or form. A must if you haven't already seen it.	100	5	Brilliant	Pensionerposter
38	June 4, 2014	Fantastic made, but I love the film so much that I didn't Get the really good musicalfeeling. Don't feel the urge to see it once more.	10	3	A bit disappointed I guess	Monica64Legreid
17	June 5, 2014	The costuming was pretty incredible. We had seats in the boxes. Chairs were very uncomfortable-definitely need better seats. All in all good but not excellent!	6	4	THEATER NYC	eurtraveler2013
25	June 5, 2014	Our six year old son was not really keen at first but he was glued at the chair fot the whole performance. Recommended.	10	5	Broadway classic	Per J
19	June 6, 2014	This was not my first musical, but my first Broadway show. The theatre was beautiful and the seating was extremely comfortable. From the moment the show started you were hooked. The costumes were absolutely amazing! The kids who played Simba & Nala were terrific. They were cute and so believable. The entire cast was awesome. I really enjoyed how the characters were portrayed. It was definitely money well spent. The only complaint is the service staff working concession. They are some of the rudest people I've ever encountered. They were mean to every single person who stood in line. The lady kept complaining that she was the only person working and took it out on the patrons. They could definitely use some customer service training.	20	5	Loved It!	tvlady911
30	June 1, 2014	The Show was really good . The theater ambiance was spectacular. Excellent and talented cast, costumes, stage settings, live music, lighting etc. It was a real good experience. But it was a little too costly and do not think it was worth paying so much.	8	4	Good Broadway Experience	FrequentTravellerAZ
12	June 1, 2014	My daughter and I loved this play Hats off to all involved in presenting such a timeless and classic play I've seen it five times now and have plays to see it again in the near future	4	5	Must see of broadway	crzy000
20	June 2, 2014	The costumes are fabulous and the scenery was clever and the acting good but it just wasn't great. We all decided it was hard to get the emotional connection with the stage play that you got in the movie. Not sure if it is due to the large theater or just the nature of the story but we left uninspired. If I knew then what I know now, I would have selected a different show to see. All in the party agreed.	10	3	Good not great show	Heidi M
34	June 3, 2014	2nd time seeing this and still LOVED the costumes and choreography. The theatre is in a lovely location for the lights at night and surrounded by great resturants	22	5	2nd Time Around	Robin R
20	May 28, 2014	Beautiful performance, it was amazing. We truly enjoyed the show, the artistry in the dancing, music and costumes is was all worth it!	6	5	Worth seeing!	loves2boys
52	May 29, 2014	So beautiful, so exciting, the beginning is magnificent, brought tears to my eyes. Book in advance. It's an experience you'll remember forever	18	5	Beautiful	jfc21
51	May 29, 2014	We have just returned from our honeymoon in NYC  On our last night we attended this show!!! It was great way to end our trip! One of the best shows I have seen! Well worth seeing	50	5	Great night out	Mod989
17	May 29, 2014	Took my boyfriend to see this show for his birthday and we had a great time. We are both fans of the movie and it is amazing how the show was brought to the stage. It's is a great theatrical experience.	19	4	Fun for all ages	TravelinTiffNYC
61	May 28, 2014	Excellent show with incredible costume designs, stunning stage choreography and sets, with marvelous, powerful music that makes for an unforgettable evening of theater. It will satisfy all ages, and spark imagination, amazement and evoke the grandeur of the story. Intertwine with some fun characters, very slightly-scary antagonist, and the emotional storyline.... will enthrall all. Spectacular show...	64	5	Amazing, spectacular & Wonderful for all ages	Unbiased&FairAdvisor
26	May 28, 2014	A group of us native New Yorkers went to see Lion King on Broadway. This show Roars ...it is a must see. So on your next visit go to the show and have a fabulous dinner at Carmine's (very good Italian food).	17	5	Lion King Roar's on Broadway	John_Silk
119	May 28, 2014	Book prices well in advance so you can secure a good seat!  This was an unique experience. On weekdays you can find very good deals.	38	5	Unique experience	Georgi_Tsvetanov
98	May 28, 2014	The animals just come down the aisles so close you really feel a part of the whole show. Our seats were so close when the giraffe leaned forward he was right in my lap. Just a fabulous show not to be missed	27	5	Breathtaking opening	Jodie W
17	May 27, 2014	the seating was great the show excellent don't miss this one !! the outfits were colorful just a magic night	5	5	brilliant	Harfo1962
19	May 28, 2014	You will feel transported for a few hours into another land! The music, dancing, costumes are so enjoyable to see!	1	5	Fantastic- A Visual Spectacle!	Ed C
55	May 28, 2014	Attended the Lion King show on Broadway with a grieving relation. It was so lovely that we both forgot the loss long enough to laugh, clap, shed a tear or two for the dead king and so on. It's now, in my mind, the best gift I can give anyone visiting me in New York. Was just simply spectacular!	41	5	Awesome - worth every penny spent	Chi_Chi2111_11
45	May 28, 2014	Will exceed all your expectations....animals come to life before your eyes...amazing experience...of young and old alike....artistry is fabulous....does not disappoint. Disney is always a top-notch production !	17	5	Magnificent .....	Lisag11414
25	May 21, 2014	This show had the most incredible costumes and set. The story is obviously not original or different from the movie, but the set is absolutely amazing. The way the show illustrates the story is unique, and the costumes are done in a beautiful and original way. We loved the show because there is just so much to see - so much visual engagement.	6	5	Amazing set and costumes	OliviaA_NYC
34	May 22, 2014	My granddaughter and I took a trip to NYC in April for her 16 th birthday. I wanted to take her to a Broadway show that I felt would be a fabulous one for her first show. Gosh, was it awesome. She thoroughly enjoyed it despite the talking people behind us. I would recommend this to everyone. 	17	5	Must See This	Linda C
64	May 23, 2014	Since this has been praised I had my hopes up high. The musical was good, very good, but not excellent. Matilda (last year in London) beats this anytime. Skillful actors and a very visual show, but something just was missing.	46	4	Quite nice	Anniina K
77	May 27, 2014	Still fantastic after all these years! Third time I've seen it, and it still does not disappoint. Well done with a superior cast.	44	5	Still fantastic	seabri
38	May 15, 2014	After 10 years, I decided it was a perfect time to resee the magical Lion King with a visiting friend. What a mistake. Somewhere, someone at Disney has lost the plot and succumbed to reaping profit over quality. The play opened at The New Amsterdam Theater with a huge center aisle that allowed three to five avenues for the magical entrance opening Circle of Fire number.. To fit more seats, the Minskoff has 2... Magic much diminished...but the worst is the acoustics..you can not even hear what Scar is saying or singing and a new Raffiki was not a wondrous Baboon...she had no power..it was almost a high school production with grown up Broadway prices...shame, shame... Now the audience of tourists still were happy, so they get away with it....but I needed to get my proud Big Apple 2 cents in! Rent the movie instead!	25	2	Roars No More	Suzanne T
17	May 17, 2014	a total enjoyment, a must see play if your in New York City. The animals are so life like that you forget there is a person working the animal.	12	5	best play ever	deb81Brockway
291	May 18, 2014	What a wonderful experience. I suggest anyone with kids/grandkids, take them to this production. We went to a matinee, and it was very crowded, so I suggest you get your tickets in advance. 	80	5	One of the best we have seen on Broadway.	mcdj0hn
41	May 19, 2014	I went with my 23 year old son who loved the movie as a young boy so when we were both in New York chose this show to see together. It was truly awesome and brought tears to my eyes at times. The set and costumes were amazing and the performers simply outstanding. Young Simba and Nala were fantastic and Timon absolutely hilarious. It was a great night and we both came away unable to stop smiling.	17	5	Awesome	AussieEssem
63	May 13, 2014	The play was beautiful to watch. The costumes, effects, etc were all stunning. However, the vocal talent was seriously lacking. It was actually the worst vocal performance I've seen on Broadway.	16	3	Visually Amazing but Vocally it Fell Short	Jamie F
138	May 14, 2014	Set design and music are superb! Everything a Broadway play should be and more. We sat in the balcony and characters from the play came up with props as a part of the performance. My daughter loved it.	47	5	Beautiful	joannnacal
54	May 14, 2014	I saw it years ago, when it was a new show. This show is very visually entertaining. When it first came it, it was one of the first to use puppets and humans in this manner.	52	4	Great Show	DC_Traveler
17	May 14, 2014	It is an expensive show but take the cheap seats - there's not a bad seat in that theatre! Get something to drink before you get there though - a bottle of water was $4.50!!	17	5	Fabulous!	Derbytoon
28	May 10, 2014	I'm not a huge fan of musicals, but artistry in this show is amazing and it's totally worth seeing. Especially recommended for a night out with young children	24	5	Worth Seeing	sanda2011
77	May 11, 2014	Of course the costumes and puppets were great. The kids got really excited when they came down the aisle. We went as a couple but would have enjoed it more with kids. It really is a kid's show, exactly like a Disney animated movie. Exact same formula. So, for those of us who have there and done that, I wouldn't necessarily go out of your way to see this if you don't have kids with you. There are to many great grown-up things to enjoy in NYC without bothering with.a trip to Disney.	36	4	Better with kids	Tigercat1
22	May 12, 2014	"We loved this show on broadway. I am a big Disney Fan and missed this when it was touring in Orlando so we decided to see it when we were in New York last month. Kudos to all the cast, it was fabulous. A standing ""O"" for sure."	15	5	Great Performance at the Minskoff	Jenny J
47	May 13, 2014	"The show requires having seen the Disney movie at some point to understand it. The actors play animals, and it's a little difficult to see past the human face and lion face both looking out, or the green man behind Timon... but the sets and the costumes are out of this world phenomenal. The show is very African-themed, while you don't get that out of the movie, considering they are all animals in the movie, and my husband was a bit taken aback by that. The music is NOT the Disney music, which I didn't mind, but I had hoped to hear ""circle of life"" - no such luck. I thought the actor portraying Young Simba was awesome, and also Scar, and Rafiki was perfect (although female). Incredibly, our 8 year old twins stayed awake until it finished at 11pm - 3 hours past their regular bedtime - that's a thumbs up right there!"	30	4	The kids and I loved it, hubby not so much.	Teresa G
38	May 7, 2014	A visual experience from beginning to end. The costumes were magnificent and the sets beautiful and very cleverly done. The music was good too! Most enjoyable experience 	13	5	Fabulous!	Astrid61
27	May 7, 2014	The Minskoff Theater is an excellent facility. The staging of the Lion King with all the costumes was uplifting. Cast looked like they enjoyed what they were doing.	8	5	Lion King Review	Harv47
343	May 7, 2014	This was the first time I had seen Lion King. It was WONDERFUL! The music, characters, scenery... all perfect. We did buy our seats in advance online. We had heard but didn't verify that there are not last minute seats for Lion King. Highly recommend	87	5	Wow!	labguides
44	May 8, 2014	Huge production - the actors in their animal costumes moved just like the real thing, even when singing, which must be very difficult. The stage-set was amazing and the overall impression and atmosphere was better than anything I have ever seen.	18	5	Breathtaking	Gudrun B
8	May 3, 2014	Great costumes, music, storyline.. Front row seats made the most of the magic! The size of the theatre was perfect..	29	5	Amazing	650nini
43	May 4, 2014	We went to a Sunday matinee. The costumes were fabulous and it was a great musical (and I'm not much into musicals).	13	5	Great show.	Dianne Z
143	May 5, 2014	Normally i don't care for musicals. But the lion king....you saw this animation movie in the cinema. and that movie is now played by real people. really loved it. was my third visit to NY and now i wanted to see a musical on Broadway. i think this is fun for almost all ages. Theatre is very nice as well. really worth your visit!	131	5	beautiful!	m-town2185
1	May 6, 2014	This show captures your attention from the opening number to the end. There is so much to see between the the costume designs and the musical numbers it is a must see a few times to take it all in!!. Indulge....	1	5	Artistry	720Joy_
53	April 29, 2014	Not being a huge fan of going to the theatre, I wasn't 100% looking forward to going to see The Lion King. Having been to both productions in London and NYC, I felt I wouldn't need to see it again. But after being persuaded by my partner to go see it as she hadn't we decided to go on her birthday to the show on Broadway. Having not even seen the film in the last 10 years, I was totally wrong, how much of a pleasant suprise was it for me. I was hooked from start to finish and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is the most expensive show you can go to, but its worth every penny. We didnt have the best seats in the theatre, but I honestly don't think it matters where you sit, everywhere would be incredible.	11	5	Most famous theatre	Lewis-in-London
6	April 29, 2014	"After reviewing the calendar of shows for April 2014, my group of 4 women could only all agree on the Lion King (based on friends who had seen it). It was definitely the more expensive show on Broadway but we figured that this might be our only time in NYC. We went on a Saturday matinee so a majority of the audience was under 4 feet tall making it easy to see from most seats. We had second row mezzanine, center stage. Could not ask for more perfect seats.  Only suggestion is do not arrive late!!!! The opening is the most amazing part of the show and a lot of people missed it. The ushers did let them in after the curtain closed after the opening and all I wanted to do was yell ""REWIND! These people missed the best part!"" Rafiki opening gave me complete goose bumps and had a hard time holding back tears because it was so beautifully done. I will also admit that I thought that Scar was an absolutely brilliant villain. It was also fun to read the playbill after the show to see that a majority of the crew was new to Broadway. Please, don't hesitate. Splurge a little and enjoy the show."	2	5	Cast full of Broadway Debutes	travels_with_elle
51	May 1, 2014	It's hard to add to the superlatives already lavished on this show so I will try and focus on a few highlights. The spectacle as a whole is wonderful - the line between the costumes and the actors is visible and it's fun to bounce between watching the performance that the puppets are giving, versus that of the actors. I found this particularly enjoyable with Timon - a brilliant performance in every sense. Scar does, however, steal the show - to the extent that my 4 year old wanted a Scar stuffed toy after the show (they don't sell them at the show although eBay seems to have a few) without playing up the evil side too heavily, it's just great to see the energy he puts into the role. Rafiki is wonderful as well, and seems to be operating on a completely different level to the rest of the show. Enjoy!	24	5	Insanely amazing show	PhlashPhlash
132	May 1, 2014	This was a second opportunity for me to see the show. The first time was in 2012. I was so pleasantly surprised to see new scenes, sets, music, dance and costumes. The storyline went into more detail and kept my attention for the entire performance. The cast, singers and dancers, and entire crew do great credit to this production. It is a visual and aural epiphany for the viewer and can easily be the highlight of your next time in NYC. Highly recommended!	40	5	A lion of a show!	William H
6	April 23, 2014	Absolutely beautiful. You better know the story before you go because it is not always easy to understand the singers/actors (bad sound balance ?). Worth every penny (but avoid the bar where a small bottle of water costs $5)	83	5	Colorful	Denis L
3	April 24, 2014	Our teen daughter really wanted to see Wicked, but since the adults in the group had already seen it, we chose The Lion King instead. It was PERFECT! Our daughter is thinking about studying Theater Technology or something similar, and we had no idea that this show was the perfect show for seeing what can be done with imagination and technology!  If you go, get seats on the aisle as the characters perform in the aisles as well as the stage. I don't think there is a bad seat in this theater anyway. 	60	5	Absolutely fabulous	Linda K
224	April 24, 2014	I was nervous about a 2 1/2 hour show with the hubby and 2 kids ages 7 and 9. Wow was I surprised. This show fits every age group, even if you know nothing about the Disney movie. In fact, of us 4 I was the only one who had seen it 20 years ago! The show was amazing and seeing it in NYC gives it a whole other type of experience. The sound and graphics were all outstanding. Spend the money and go see this show. You will be happy you did!	128	5	Best show I've ever seen! Kids loved it too!	mamaarora
14	April 26, 2014	Was really good. Try and get seats in the centre of the theatre but there is not really a terrible seat in the place. 	10	5	hakunamatata	hwal45
226	April 18, 2014	I have seen The Lion King before in Los Angeles. This seemed to be a trimmed down cast, but just as energetic. My granddaughter thoroughly enjoyed it. Actors are strong performers and the play moves along well. 	87	4	Good Family Entertainment	aandmrun
23	April 19, 2014	While in NYC this last time, I had the chance to see The Lion King. I had heard how great it was and how breathtaking the costumes and the music were, but the reviews do NOT do it justice.  WHAT AN AMAZING SHOW!!! I was just blown away by everything I saw and heard that night. The costumes, the music, the talent on that stage..it just all blew me away. I know I spent most of the first 15 minutes of the show just crying it was so overwhelming [when the animals come out and parade to Pride Rock. THAT alone was worth the price of the ticket. WOW!]. I would see this again in a heartbeat. It was that amazing.  Even more amazing was that the people I saw it with knew one of the cast members and we were allowed to then go BACKSTAGE and see everything up close and personal. Standing on that stage looking out at the empty auditorium was surreal and unnerving. I do not know how they do that night after night. That was such a bonus treat and I am so grateful I got to experience it.	17	5	WOW! A MUST-SEE SHOW!!	DawnMichelleK
34	April 21, 2014	Attended with our 8 and 5 year old kids and they loved it. An amazing theatrical production and we were all captivated throughout the show. Really beautiful.	19	5	Great with kids!	Mwardlucas
55	April 22, 2014	Lion King had amazing costumes and scenery. The performers were top notch and perfect for each role they portrayed. The show is great for all ages. 	16	5	Spectacular	Adrian_JMA
96	April 15, 2014	If you liked the movie, you will love the show. Beautifully done. Perfect for all ages. It will be an even you won't soon forget!	35	5	Loved it!	VNYNY
68	April 16, 2014	First, I loved the movie, so I wanted to know how this play would take that story and wow me. They produced a wonderful play, all the characters looked real and they were colorful and moved around like the animals they were supposed to depict. I would recommend to families with kids that it may not be for children under 6 years old. My son got bored and fell asleep 1 hr into the show, mind you he LOVES the movie.	16	5	Colorful and spectacular	TRAVELLIFE69
24	April 17, 2014	Me ,My son (7 years old ) and my wife were mesmerized . It was just fantastic. We were so spellbound by the show . Set design, Music, Lights , stage craft, choreography and acting and singing will cast a spell on you. It is to be seen to be believed!!!	45	5	FANTASTIC AND BRILLIANT.	Mahua G
32	April 17, 2014	Maybe im expecting too much or sth else, I don't go to theatre a lot but I do go once in a while. However, the Lion King its really just so so. It was great in the beginning, however it fell apart after that. It can defiantly be better than that. Disappointed. 	76	4	Maybe im expecting too much	yi mien t
16	April 7, 2014	The actors and costumes were truly UNBELIEVABLE! I will definitely be seeing this show again. Kids/Adults of all ages will enjoy. From the first 5 minutes to the last second, I was hooked. Spend the $ for sure, worth every penny!	11	5	MUST SEE!	Christy O
51	April 12, 2014	It was the best show that I have ever seen! The actors and actresses work perfectly. The orchestra is simply perfect. The harmonization of the spectacle is unbelievable. I think everybody goes to New York should see this attraction. I recommend to buy the ticket in any Orchestra's chair.	11	5	Awesome! The best show and musical! Highly recommended!	GeraldoZafalon
52	April 14, 2014	Blown away by the incredible talent in this show. The costumes were wonderful and the theatre is the BEST.	34	5	Amazing Production	LuvsTravel273
82	April 14, 2014	Our 6-yr old daughter and 11 yr old son both loved it. This was their first Broadway musical. They talked about the costumes, the music and the child actors. A highlight of our 4 day trip to NYC.	26	5	Children mesmorized	SereneBlue
33	June 11, 2014	This show is a must see!!!  Oh my god it is amazing ... The costumes, the decors, the actors, the story ... Simply crazy amazing!!!  Loved it from beginning to end and still ... I would have taken more! It was a great experience!	14	5	Amazing!!!	Inoxxydable
58	June 15, 2014	Growing up with the wonderful Disney film, I was interested to see how this would pan out on broadway. I've seen dozens of broadway plays but this is my absolute favorite broadway play. It is amazing, the costumes and makeup is absolutely stunning and the play is an instant heart warmer. It is good for all ages and I definitely recommend this broadway experience. It is a play you will not forget! Go and ENJOY! :)	148	5	MY favorite broadway play...	CloudTenReviews
25	June 17, 2014	Loved the show. Well worth seeing. Lovely theatre. Excellent cast - wanted to see again, but too many other shows to try to fit in on our visit!	8	5	Brilliant	Catherine C
144	June 19, 2014	I was amazed at the costumes in this show. I have never seen anything like it. I was astounded and pleasantly surprised at what a wonderful production this truly was. I was expecting more of a children's production, but this was absolutely fantastic. Well worth the ticket cost.	66	5	One fantastic production!	GreaterJersey
87	June 22, 2014	The performers are awesome! The music is wonderful! Tickets sell out so get yours early! The show is all around you in the theater! You will leave wanting to see it again!	32	5	My absolute favorite on Broadway!	27travelbug1995
75	June 24, 2014	I would recommend this show to every single person that goes to New York. The cast, the costumes, the singing were out of this world. This was my first production that I have seen and not my last. Loved it.	38	5	Amazing	WelshWizard2014
13	June 29, 2014	This is why you get out of your house to see a Broadway show! Unbelievable art, costumes, stage effects! Kids from the age of 10 and up can start to appreciate it too. Beautiful show!	3	4	Best costumes and Art direction	Tal S
9	July 1, 2014	I spent two weeks in America and this was one of the higlhlights of my holiday. I had goose bumps from start to finish, it was that good. Would see this musical over and over again.	9	5	Outstanding	Jo L
17	July 5, 2014	Was very expensive but totally worth it and loved it!! Husband isn't a musical fan but even he thoroughly enjoyed it! Aim for middle to back seating as that way you can see the cast as they come down the aisles! Definitely a must see show!!	4	5	Amazing!!!	Amanda G
24	July 8, 2014	Everything we expected, songs, costumes and performers excellent seats quite expensive but very good arranged via hotel	9	5	Wonderful	Jackie O
40	July 11, 2014	Seeing The Lion King at the Minskoff Theatre was just amazing! The theatre itself is absolutely fabulous with amazing views of Times Square from the foyer (make sure you go at night to get the full Impact!). The production itself was the best I have ever seen! Everything was top notch and just kept you riveted. The costumes, cast, props etc. were absolutely beautiful - I have never seen anything quite so amazing!!	32	5	Awe inspiring	Ruth R
16	July 13, 2014	A famous and popular show, so not surprisingly great! I found everything about it inspiring. Only thing I would advise is as a woman do not expect to be able to use the loos during the intervals, its not worth your time - a few people missed some of the second half.	9	5	Fantastic Show	RachelRoo1992
56	July 15, 2014	Everyone must see Lion King at least once in their lifetime! I've seen it 4 times and counting! The costumes make this animated story come to life like you wouldn't believe! A staple for your Bucket List!	23	5	Broadway staple!	Kevin M
7	July 18, 2014	What a brilliant show. Almost reduced me to tears, the costumes, music and overall performance was mind blowing.a must see show !	5	5	Costume extravaganza!	31Kim
51	July 21, 2014	tickets are expensive but the show was very good.No distractions from recording mobiles as it is not allowed.	12	5	great show	JEHE2615
46	July 22, 2014	Went in a large school (middle) group. The kids were enthralled. Costumes were great, storyline follows the Disney movie. 	10	4	Excellent Play	urchie10
34	July 24, 2014	Went to see the lion king on the 8th July for the evening performance. Im not a big theatre goer but have seen a few shows in the past. The lion king was visually outstanding and had funny bits too. I did find myself a bit bored throughout some of the solos though and the drinks prices are absolutely disgusting, I think i paid 10 dollars for a small can of beer... Wouldnt go back for the price ($160 per ticket) but im sure alot of avid theatre goers loved it.	39	4	Good but no great	jamouse21
32	July 25, 2014	Fantastic - great performance, absolutely loved every minute of the show and it went past so fast. The costumes are brilliant! If you go to NYC can fully recommend this show.	20	5	Pumbaa!	Stephen L
33	July 26, 2014	The first time I took my daughter she was 3, she loved the show so much that now she's 7 and she's already seen it 4 times! The costumes are breathtaking! Even though it is long, the hours go by like seconds! Definetly a MUST SEE!	20	5	Best show on broadway for kids	Emiliana D
50	July 27, 2014	Excellent show and one of my favorites!! It's a bit long, but may have seemed that way since I've seen several times. 	26	5	I love the Lion King!	Funmom123
13	July 27, 2014	Fun for the whole family. The cast were amazing and the costume and design sets well thought out.  Although it was a fabulous theatre production, at $200 a ticket it proves to be an expensive afternoon for a family of 4	6	5	Fantastic	jesssmithy
194	July 23, 2014	Take the kids and get a seat in the aisle, at one point the actors - animals troupe down the aisle. The show is great and the kids will keep you up all night talking about it. 	46	5	Love NYC	Italyinjune07
77	July 23, 2014	Wonderful show one of the highlights of our trip!!! Disney does it again with an amazing show experience! Refreshments are very pricey though! 	40	5	Amazing show!!!	Sherrikt
79	July 23, 2014	I purchased Premium seats to this performance and it was great. I saw the movie and wanted to see the differences of the 2 and they were similar. The acting was great and the location was close to times square. Everybody in all backgrounds enjoyed this show and the whole production was amazing. Currently saw this show approximately 6 times. This is a must see show in New York compared to the other musicals and plays.	24	5	Amazing show!	JeromeJacobs
64	July 24, 2014	We went to the Saturday afternoon 2pm show after buying tickets the night before as they had a few odd seats left. We arrived at 1.30 and the queue to get in was around the corner but to be honest it was a little pointless as if you walked to the door they let you straight in. We had seats on the front row of the mezzanine (not bad for last minute tickets) which were great as we were up high we could see everything that was going on.  I won't say too much to spoil it for anyone thinking of going, but if you are in NY this show is a MUST. Its about 2 and half hours long with a 15 minute break. There were quite a lot of small children in the audience which we expected for an afternoon show but because the show is just non stop the kids there made no fuss or noise as they were taken in by it all. Go and See it!!!!	40	5	You can see why this is a sell out!! Amazing	afc64
18	July 22, 2014	Great show and a world class production - our kids loved it. It was their first NY Broadway play and they were blown away! Definitely a little pricey but worth the experience. I think we paid around $850.00 for 4 tickets (third row from the stage, front and center). Kids were ages 9 & 11. Attended on 2/09/13.	12	5	Amazing Show! Kids were blown away.	Matthew C
293	July 22, 2014	This show is for all ages. Beautiful musical and very well presented. Do not buy tickets closer than the 12 - 15th rows or you miss a good part of the show.	66	5	Spectacular costumes and actors	Jerry K
37	July 22, 2014	I loved it!!!!!!!!!!! I cant describe how much I love this broadway show. The customs, the scenery, the actors, everythig was perfect!	24	5	Best broadway show ever seen	MaryC_13
23	July 22, 2014	The choreography was very impressive. It appeared that all of the seats were good throughout the entire theater. The costumes were very impressive as well. Well done all around!	9	5	very impressive, a must see at least once. no wonder it has been on Broadway for so long!!	888Mary
89	July 18, 2014	We went to the Lion King with my 10 year old son and his elderly grandparents. Although granddad fell asleep (as usual), the rest of us thoroughly enjoyed the incredible costuming, the creative choreography, and some great performances--especially from the boy who acted the role of SImba as a child. For a big city Broadway spectacle, it fulfilled!	55	5	Fabulous Costumes, compelling music	willijr
102	July 19, 2014	Never been to a Broadway Show, but glad we chose this one. Not only did the kids love it, but the wife and myself thoroughly enjoyed it. We paid regular price and still worth it. But if you can find discounted tickets, that would be nice. But don't be afraid to pay the regular price, well worth it. WOULD DO AGAIN!!	12	5	Would do Again!!!!!!	Roy G
29	July 19, 2014	This show was one of the best I've ever seen! First Broadway experience for my 8 and 10 Year olds and they were entranced! If you are traveling to NYC with kids this is the show to see- or Even without kids! 	10	5	Excellent show! 	THC9
8	July 20, 2014	My sister is from Japan and told me the story is exactly the same as the cartoon written by Osamu Tezuka. He is not dead more than 10 years and he should get recognition as the author. As far as dancers, they all look fit and attractive and we liked their head masks, too.	1	4	Story line	Fujieweise
8	July 16, 2014	It definitely lived up to the hype. Wonderful performance. Like most of the NYC theaters the seats are tiny!	77	4	I loved it , so did the kids!	Bala C
14	July 17, 2014	This show was spectacular, it literally brought tears to my eyes. The highlight of our trip! It was a emotional performance. I suggest paying the extra for the better seats, you won't regret it... 	3	5	Amazing, worth every penny!!	PRM413
550	July 17, 2014	going to NYC and not seeing a Broadway show is almost a sin. I went to see the Lion King and it was amazing, after I left the show I was feeling happy and feelinf like to another musical straigh away. The cast is talented and impressive.	157	5	Really good	rmcc83
30	July 18, 2014	went to the box office 30 minutes before showtime for a sold out performance and grabbed 4 seats in center section of orchestra. fabulous evening	12	5	Last minute Lion King	illini13
24	July 13, 2014	This is a great family friendly show that everyone will enjoy. The costumes are beyond amazing and the acting is suburb.	15	5	Classic NYC Musical	nyctravelgirl2
12	July 14, 2014	I went with my Granddaughter and we were thrilled with the music, singing, stage props, everything! We didn't want it to end!	10	5	Wonderful show for all ages!	ACTK8331
11	July 15, 2014	Was advised to go to see the lion king by friends and it was amazing. The detail and production was fantastic. Scar was so good it was like watching the movie. It's a must see broadway show.	8	5	Awesome	Gary G
12	July 15, 2014	We went to NYC for our runaway wedding amd decided to see something on broadway while we were there. We chose the lion king because we fell in love when it came to our home town of Anchorage Alaska and it did not disappoint even though we had seen it before and we would definitely see it again. The stage presence and set up was incredible. Such a movimg performance. 	5	5	Ahhh mazing!	brittchamp
15	July 12, 2014	The Lion King was amazing! Such an experience to see this fantastic show on Broadway! My family thoroughly enjoyed it!	13	5	Amazing	Paul L
74	July 12, 2014	What a wonderful show for kids. The acting was top notch and I cannot say enough about the costumes and scenery. If you get the chance, take the kids. They will love it.	23	4	Excellent for kids	Melanie S
44	July 13, 2014	Decided to try this musical on Broadway instead of all the many other options and while it was good it wasn't worth the $200+ paid. The costumes and acting were good but some of the staging and solo pieces were a little tired. It came across as yes we do this 8 times a week and are not really in the zone any more. Drop the price for the quality. 	20	3	Good but far too expensive	Fishp77
34	July 13, 2014	the musical is great!!! even though we suffered from terrible jetlag we enjoyed it from the beginning till the end.everything is awesome:set,costumes,decorations,music ,plot and,of course,actors!they're just brilliant.the price is high, but it's worth it ,besides, we found discounted tickets on travelzoo.mezz row f-exellent view.	27	5	great entertainment for all ages	liudmila336
80	July 8, 2014	I'd wanted ot see this show for ages, but was reluctant to pay the high prices that were being charged in London. I decided to treat myself on holiday, and it was sooo worth it! The costumes are stunning, the songs are excellent, and the scenery is just out of this world!!	25	5	Stunning!!	653AnnFrank
3	July 8, 2014	I wouldn't say I'm a fan of musicals. The only one I've been to previously was Mary Poppins...and boy was that a long night! We attended a matinee on a Sunday afternoon. The theatre was a little smaller than expected but our seats were great. The whole production was so well put together and everything from the music, costumes and stage were impressive!	2	5	Great experience!	supersoniceagle
3	July 9, 2014	Wow! Wonderful show, wonderful costumes, wonderful singers, wonderful actors, just wonderful. This show will please even the toughest of audiences. 	5	5	Broadway masterpiece	Melissa G
74	July 10, 2014	I have wanted to see this forever, so I guess my expectations were a little too high. It was good, but not great. We had good seats, but something about it just didn't click for me.	23	3	NOT THAT IMPRESSED	Cheryl M
63	July 5, 2014	Amazing! Spectacular! Breathtaking! You have to see this! What talent! I want to see this again!!! Tip: Get an aisle seat; we were in the 3rd row, on the aisle, and were definitely not disappointed!	38	5	Do not miss this show!!!	Rene R
4	July 6, 2014	A clear disapointment. The scenography is sometimes brilliat but for most of the part it looks like something out of a school play. Same goes with the singing numbers. The enjoyable parts are few and far apart. If you love the film you are better off getting the DVD than going to the show and if you love musicals there are far better ones out there.	2	3	Overhyped!	Urban J
77	July 7, 2014	"This was my first visit to times square and how could I have missed the lion king show. My initial reaction when I paid the ticket amount was "" Ah!! it did hit my pocket"" But the show was worth it. The stage was very well done and lighting was tremendous. However, I feel it would have been better with kids. My daughter would have enjoyed more and I would have enjoyed more seeing her enjoying."	47	4	Ahh it did hit the pocket!!	PravalUpadhyay
25	July 7, 2014	Everything about this was first class, the children especially were fantastic. A wonderful evening, the highlight of our trip to NYC.	12	5	Amazing!	1004Chris
441	July 1, 2014	The costumes and sets are amazing as expected but the songs didn't seem as compelling. Also because it's sold through Ticketmaster, I didn't see any discounts offered through TKTS. Even last minute tickets being sold when I picked up the tickets before the show were $155 cash only! 	206	3	fabulous sets	tropicalnorth
150	July 2, 2014	Magical, I have no words. It was expensive but totally worth it. One of the best moments of our trip. 	151	5	The best show!	mLouisa12
9	July 3, 2014	We left at half time, disappointed. The music nor production captivated. Another group were leaving ahead if us. We went to the matinee on 29/6/2014	3	3	Left early	Kiwi602014
2	July 3, 2014	Don't trust everything you read on here because many are out to sabatoge shows for whatever reason. That said, this show is an extravaganza, a unique combo of brilliant set design, puppeteering, music and dance. Combine all this with a good story and singing and you have one of the most successful shows in the history of broadway. The reflection scene with Simba and his deceased father is pure broadway magic and if among the most memorable moments by far.	180	5	Superb	Paul B
102	June 30, 2014	So moving we watched much of it on Tv and now saw it. Emotional was to say the least! Prepare to go slowly there I a lot to see.	23	5	9/11 Memorial Museum	Jo R
53	June 30, 2014	I was so excited to see this show. It was everything I expected and more! The actors were fabulous and the costumes and music were so incredible! Highly recommended!!	24	5	Absolutely Amazing!	900Ashley
83	June 30, 2014	I'm not sure what I expected since I am not a musical fan. It was very nice especially the start. So well made. But it is such a hype that I expected it to be even grander. Quite a small theatre really. VERY expensive.	32	3	Such a hype, I expected more	RenateVink
22	July 1, 2014	Loved the Lion King and the Minskoff Theater. The theater was not too big but there really is not a bad seat in the house. The play was unbelievable and I would see it again. It is going to be playing in Milwaukee in December and I am definitely going to take the grandkids, they will love it.	12	5	Moved to tears!	jillwork116
131	June 26, 2014	I took my family as part of a 21st birthday celebration visit to NYC (from England). The show was every bit as good as everyone says. The cast were excellent and the sets, lighting and music superb. I definitely recommend it.	41	5	A Great Show	BucksTraveller99
2	June 27, 2014	The show was amazing! It's a magic story. From the beginning until the end perfect! Amazing artist and singers! Really mind blowing :-)	1	5	Beautiful show!	Soulcon
70	June 28, 2014	"I personally liked the touring version I saw in florida better because of stage and house depth but everyone should see the lion king when they can. Another benefit of seeing it out of new York, is that unless you get tickets long in advance, most tickets have to be bought through third party scalpers here. Certain shows in nyc are bought out by ticket sellers and then resold at a profit. I don't like that practice.  Also since the show is something like 20 years old, the technology is dated. Kids wont notice, but if you go to a more modern show on broadway there is a more ""high definition"" feel with brighter colors thanks to newer lighting technology. Still a very good show though!"	23	4	Everyone should see the lion king	Brian P
54	June 28, 2014	This is my second time seeing this production as I remember viewing it in the New Amsterdam Theatre with the original broadway cast. The Minskoff Theatre is terrible at hosting lion king inside as the space is not appropriate for such a major production such as this. The set (especially the rising stage) and costumes are still extraordinary although vocals and dancing have reached a falling action. The New Amsterdam was so much better suited for a hit show and the architecture does not compare in TNA. Although its still a great show to see but not as good as some others competitors such as Phantom, Wicked, or Book of Mormon.	62	3	The Circle of Life Continues	EBWhite123
20	June 22, 2014	"We were thrilled to get center orchestra seats for this much hyped production. Phenomenal to see the opening scene with all of the huge puppets coming down the aisles. But by the end of the show, we were, well, underwhelmed. Perhaps we expected too much after the raves we have heard and the excellent marketing. The talent was excellent, but much of the staging frankly looked amatueurish. One example: the huge sunrise at the end got hung up like a venitian blind and stayed that way. The shadow renderings were awful. There was a lot of running about and screaming, reminiscent of a high school play on steroids. The acoustics are not good, even with our ""excellent"" seats. At times it dragged. We actually felt relieved when the show ended. Perhaps it's been running so long that they don't feel compelled to improve what needs to be improved. But people seem to forgive all of this and continue to rave. Anyhow, in my opinion, Lion King is not at all worth the outlandish price of the tickets."	15	3	Disappointing	rogerspinner
18	June 23, 2014	I was excited to see it and wasn't at all disappointed!! I've seen several other Broadway plays and this was one of the best for sure!!	8	5	Would Watch it Again!	MandyStarr
5	June 24, 2014	Controversial review as the entire global population seems to adore this show however I was incredibly disappointed after expecting great things. I appreciate it is is difficult to convery the animals on stage however the puppets were bizarre and verging on amateur. The chap who played Mufasa was so wooden and awkward I was actually looking forward to the death scene so I didnt have to watch him anymore. Overall a very odd cringeworthy experience which I wouldn't recommend. 	2	2	Waste of money	bambino1505
4	June 24, 2014	I've seen many Broadway plays and this production was one of the best I've ever seen. I would see this one again in a heartbeat the next time I come to NYC	1	5	One of the best I've seen	Heather S
23	June 19, 2014	This show was amazing! Everyone who visits NYC must have an experience seeing a show on Broadway and if you do - why not make it the Lion King? Tickets are $$$ however you will not be dissapointed! The venue was wonderful, the cast were amazing - so talented and the show was flawless. The effects were just spectacular! A great experience for both young and old.	17	5	No#1 Show to see in NYC	Jez-a-lou
75	June 20, 2014	The show is fantastic for all age groups. It's difficult,probably impossible to get discount tickets but I assure you it's worth the price you pay.I don't want to give away details cos it's just so fantastic...you just have to see it to believe it.	37	5	Do not miss this show!!!	SAtraveller2013
163	June 21, 2014	On the advice of a friend we 2 adults saw the Lion King. Since I am a beginner at sewing I could appreciate the intricacy and inventiveness of the costumes. You don't have to be a kid or take kids to enjoy this show. 	138	4	Finally saw it	stonewell
69	June 22, 2014	Saw Lion King elsewhere but always wanted to see it on Boadway. Must pay full price, no discount tickets at TKTS Booth in Times Square. Enjoyed the musical immensely.	25	5	Second Viewing	Carefree2008
11	June 17, 2014	This show is a must see in New York City. The production is so well done and we were swept away by the elaborate sets, beautiful costumes, and wonderful singing and music. A word of caution, don't expect to make it through the bathroom line at intermission, they don't have enough facilities for that kind of crowd.	1	5	So Exciting	Deb P
13	June 17, 2014	I've traveled to NYC many times, but this was my first Broadway play. I was not let down.  We had 8th row seats and it was if we could reach out and touch the actors! Leave it to Disney to create such a fantastic show. I highly recomend!	39	5	Fantastic	duvanb
72	June 18, 2014	I have never seen anything like it. Entertainment for all ages. I paid 99 dollars for a ticket with a brilliant view. Would happily pay more in hindsight and would love to go again.	34	5	Mind blowing	Bernyd87
14	June 18, 2014	Saw the show on Father's Day. We had a large group of 9, including children so we had to book well in advance instead of trying to get a bargain seat from TKTS. So be prepared to spend a pretty penny. That being said, the show was superb and everything we expected from a Broadway musical. You won't be disappointed!	18	5	Wonderful, don't miss it!	blondieperez
42	June 15, 2014	Absolutely fantastic even though we have seen the movie hundreds of times with the kids. Don't miss this!	16	5	fantastic	Peter M
19	June 15, 2014	Me and my boyfriend watched The Lion King on Broadway in May 2013. Even though the tickets were very expensive it was definitely worth every penny! I would 100% say this is a must see I would love to see it again. 	21	5	EXCELLENT SHOW!	Katie H
80	June 16, 2014	I had already seen the Lion King at the West End, London but my partner hadn't so we decided to treat ourselves and go whilst in NYC.  ...and I'm so glad we did. It was fantastic.  Just to say 'I've seen a show on Broadway' is great, but this show is just fantastic. The singers, the dancers, the costumes. It's very similar to the West End [obviously] but just being in NYC gave it a whole different feel. And once it had finished and we left, everyone was in such great spirits on Times Square. Phenomenal.	38	5	Out of this world	Natalie904
46	June 16, 2014	Our whole family was amazed how they were able to bring the 'jungle' to the stage. The animals and herds were so imaginative - you hardly saw the actors for seeing their character. This is a must see in NYC.	16	4	Amazing!	Vicki S
145	June 11, 2014	That is their theme and that is what they deliver. A visual, sensory escape that amuses and delights away the evening. The show has clones around the country but until you experience in the customized venue of the Minskoff Theatre you have no idea how delightful and magically entertaining the jungle can be!	81	4	See it Once, Remember it Always	unpre10ous
5	June 12, 2014	The show was great! If you enjoyed the movie you'll love the play. Everything was very expensive however: tickets and merch is always pricey, but drinks were $16 each! And the ushers were very disruptive and annoying. I understand they don't want people taking pictures, but they would not stop walking up and down the isle with their flashlight looking for the slightest move towards a phone. They also rush you and rush you out; I've been to many shows before and never seen anything like it.	5	5	Expensive, fun and a great show	z-crowley
96	June 14, 2014	Out of the three shows I saw, this show was in third place. It was a great show, but the singing was not in the same league as in Wicked and Cinderella. But in saying that, the way the show progressed, the stage adaptation of the animals and the preformers were amazing. It's was worth seeing for sure and I'm glad I went.	34	4	Great show for adults and kids	Steve M
35	June 14, 2014	First time seeing a Broadway play for our 3 children, and it was fabulous. We expected it to be very good, and it was even better than that.	9	5	What we expected and hoped for	Dugenheim
47	July 28, 2014	I loved the lion king it was worth the money the actors are talented and have strong voices. The stage props for the animals was amazing. The show is full on you can't take your eyes off it. You will love it it is packed every night.	19	5	Mesmerising	354cj
32	July 31, 2014	Very entertaining show! The props and songs, and the storyline. Kids and adults alike can watch it over and over again!  It's my second time watching the show and I still enjyoyed it!	20	4	SECOND TIME AND IT'S STILL AWESOME!	anntina21
71	August 4, 2014	Matinee on Saturday afternoon. I've seen it twice and it is still just as awesome as it was the first time. My daughter loved it and she wants to see it again. It is worth every cent we spent on tickets. Another must see while in NY.	33	5	Fantastic Show	vivo1970
70	August 5, 2014	First thing, we had never been to a Broadway show. What an experience. The performances were fantastic. Almost got run over by a Rhino since I was on the aisle. Well worth the price of admission. Our kids and I think every kid there enjoyed the whole show. Just a quick note. Just about every seat in the place looks to be good. The theatre is not as big as you would expect if you have never been to a show like this. We had great seats, row K. I do think you could pay a little less for the seats further back and still have a fantastic experience.  Definitely go!	24	5	WOW!!!	RossH1969
24	August 10, 2014	What can one say about one of the best shows on Broadway that hasn't already been said? The costumes, music, and dancing are not to be missed. The Minskoff theatre was a welcome relief for its spaciousness and air conditioning in the heat of July! 	12	5	Fantastic!	Cheryl R
12	August 13, 2014	We were in New York for a week and managed to get some tickets for a matinee via the main. Box office - yes, they were not cheap however we took our 2 x four year old boys for the first time to this big of production and they loved it! There were some scary scenes at the end of Act I involving the hyenas so we weren't too sure whether we would have to leave, however the moment passed and our boys were enthralled. The second Act was not as long after a 15 min intermission which was perfect. The set and costume design, along with the choreography was well directed and the setting within the Minskoff Theatre right on Broadway topped the icing. Note: factor in traffic time in getting to the theatre...	14	5	Excellent production for the family!	InnerWestieDamien
26	August 19, 2014	My hubby, who does not like musicals, enjoyed it! So visually entertaining! Well worth the money! The theater overlooks Times Square, so bring your camera.	15	5	Fantastic	Julie N
50	August 23, 2014	Very entertaining. The family really enjoyed it (including two boys, 11 and 13). Opening scene is awesome. It it easy to follow since most folks already know the story line. Its not cheap, most plays are not, but we all really enjoyed it and it is a great family memory. Buy tickets on line beforehand. Check various seat locations, since prices can change by $20 or $30 per seat just going back a row. So that can help, especially if buying several tickets. Highly recommended.	13	5	outstanding	steve h
50	August 26, 2014	Don't hesitate to spend a bit more to get nice seats. The beginning of the show is gorgeous, amazing. Live music is just what I wasn't thinking of. The bonus in fact. The place is nice but be careful when you order drinks at the bar. The mermaid (a strong guy with glasses) is not reliable.	26	5	A must see	swissbox
31	August 18, 2014	This was our first Broadway presentation. Singing, acting, costumes and sets were magnificant. Very enjoyable.	12	5	lion king on Broadway	chefgarry
3	August 27, 2014	The show is just amazing!!! I felt like a little child!! It’s full of color, music, dance, magic!! The best show ever	2	5	Out of this world!!!!	Doskaro
44	August 30, 2014	This is the best show we've ever seen in 30 years of seeing shows in London, New York, Verona, Sidney, Paris, and beyond! A fantastic show ,had us mesmerised from start to finish, never enough time to see everything before next scene. Can't imagine how it could be bettered. A wonderful, visual, emotional experience.	25	5	The best seen	JudyOswestryUK
19	September 1, 2014	This was a good production, the cast were fantastic,the and sound was good, also the theatre was nice and easy to find off Times Square. Good cocktails at interval. Met the cast as we were leaving the theatre and they were happy to let us take pics with them	2	5	Lion King Roars	Liza M
18	September 2, 2014	"Incredible show! Our 5 year old was spellbound as were we! Loved the ""frozen"" references thrown in for good measure. The entire cast was amazing! so happy we chose the Lion King for our daughter's first trip to Broadway!"	12	5	Unbelieveable!	familyofthreebs
24	September 3, 2014	The show was good, but the theater itself is not up to broadway standards. Acoustics not the best,were in the mezzanine. The wardrobes are the best part of the show and very creative. Nice for children but there are better shows.	10	4	Disney's Lion King	Muss28
131	September 9, 2014	This was a birthday present for our niece and my wife and I took her to see the play. Our seats were in the mezzanine section BB Row A seats 3, 5 & 7 - absolutely awesome! we were much closer to the stage than I initially thought and the view is amazing. The show is breathtaking! the opening sequence with the troop taking the stage just leaves you struck in awe! The costumes, the stage set, the colors - everything is top notch! I wholeheartedly recommend it!!!	96	5	More than I could ever imagine	CWBuff
33	September 9, 2014	Just go and see this on broadway !!! Shop around for ticket prices but please just go!!! You will not be disappointed !!! Oh but unless your budget is bottomless take snacks ... The refreshments are ridiculously expensive !! 	27	5	Wow	Liz A
785	September 9, 2014	"Lion King is a masterpiece. It should be the first and last musical you see in life. The songs are exceptional as is the script, set, costumes and entire production. ""Hakunamatata"""	319	5	First and last broadway show you should see !!!	Katrin S
47	September 5, 2014	Lion King is like no other...truly one of the best I've seen on Broadway. Have returned a few times over the years. It's a MUST SEE for everyone...at least once!	7	5	Been there, done it...several times!!!	HeidiK68
95	September 6, 2014	No wonder why it is still available to watch after so many years! Amazing performances, Great music, fantastic actors and beautiful characters.	69	5	Best Broadway show	Andrea C
44	September 7, 2014	I never meant to see this three times, but after going once with family members and again with some friends as a birthday celebration, I had guests who were dying to see it ... so we went again. And it did not disappoint. The depiction of animals and their movements are exquisite and you absolutely forget (and at the same time remain awed) that people are actually the ones performing. It is wonderful. The singing, the dancing, the choreography. I love it all. Who knows, there may be a fourth time ... 	13	5	Even better the THIRD time around! :)	NYinNYC
3	September 7, 2014	I'd love to learn how to pronounce the word in the song - you know the exact one I mean! This is such an excellent production. The costumes and scenery are incredible. The music is upbeat and the vocals are awesome. A must see	202	5	How does that song go?	Rudy C
13	September 8, 2014	We have always said we would see the Lion King on broadway while in NYC, and we were not disappointed AT ALL. The show was amazing and we even had the chance to meet a few of the actors afterwards. If you have children- you MUST take them to see this. The Theater was amazing the show was more than even we expected!	3	5	Bucket List Must	SCannady
158	September 10, 2014	After 10 plus years, we still cound not get half price ticket for the show. Finally we decided to pay full price in March, 2014 for the September's show. The show was very good, but not worth the full price ticket. I may see it again if half price ticket available.	66	4	very good, but not excellent.	Castle88
84	September 10, 2014	This show was not the first I saw on Broadway, but it was among the ones I went to see on my first trip to NYC. For those who say, you have to have kids with you to appreciate the story, they must never have gone to a Disney story musical. The costumes on incredible, their use of surrounding the audience to bring them into the story starts at the beginning and continues during and until the end. The staging for the scene where Simba looks into the stars hearing the words of his father...is magical. I guess I really allowed myself to be drawn into the story of the musical because when the last song was sung, and we were headed out, they lifted the curtain to begin clean up...and, I couldn't believe what I saw during the show really occurred on that stage. This musical is not to be missed...I haven't missed it, I've seen it 4-5 times. It comes to my city in October, and I'll be there with a friend who hasn't seen it yet. Yeah!!!	30	5	"""Oh I just can't wait""...to see it again!"	dar m
8	September 4, 2014	Great play. Wonderful presentation full of life and color go see it. If you can afford it. It is a very much better experience if you can afford to get seats in the first five rows.	11	5	See II !!!	JackJacks0n
170	September 4, 2014	We are not into shows that much, but wanted to see a show in NY. We could not have picked a better show. We both thoroughly enjoyed it	121	5	An amazing show	cromansydney
61	September 4, 2014	Always been a fan and wanted to see it live and had the chance on Broadway seats were third from the front it was out of this world	19	5	Amazing	Michelle050475
25	September 4, 2014	Entertaining show; a feast for the eyes & ears! A little lengthy, so may not be appropriate for young children.	19	4	Great show	Kemi O
32	September 2, 2014	The theater is one of the the larger Broadway venues but we loved the show. Got to meet the performers afterwards at the stage door.	7	5	Lived up to expectations!	elizabethv50
9	September 2, 2014	Truly inspiring and uplifting broadway show that you could see over and over again!! This show is one of the most memorable of all great broadway experiences.	1	5	Great entertainment!	Dak6730
12	September 3, 2014	The show no it to miss....seems to be the only show you can't get discounted tickets for, and not hard to see why! 	8	5	Amazing!!! Worth every dollar💰	Kim E
11	September 3, 2014	The Lion King is uplifting and the perfect show for families with young children as they will stay entertained. The best features of this show are the pre-show, within the lobby of the theater are costumes and costumed performers for photo ops and an up close and personal look at characters. The second best feature are the pageantry and puppetry that is outstanding. When the animal kingdom is on stage it is magical. The story itself and the main characters are ok but the kids may get bored. If you have one night to spend on Broadway and do not have children to please, consider another show. This is like a glorified movie theater experience with concessions and crowds and rails along several rows of seats (to help with crowd control and keeping the audience out of the aisle when the show begins). A better Lion King experience is actually within the Animal Kingdom park at Disney World in Florida- that show (a theatre in the round) is an up close and personal experience that shouldn't be missed. If you don't have children, spend your hard-earned money on another Broadway show.	3	3	Too much hype	swish13
16	September 1, 2014	From all, the hype I was expecting more. Singing was poor. Visually it was quite good, but I simply expected more from a broadway musical. 	11	2	Not very good	JGDwales
4	September 1, 2014	"Booked in advance through Ticketmaster to see The Lion King while on holiday over in New York. The tickets were a little on the expensive side, but I found a promotional code making it a reasonable price and definitely better than what other Broadway shows were asking *cough* Book of Mormon *cough*... We sat in Row O (in the Orchestra section just before the mezzanine level starts), in seats 115 and 116 toward the centre of the stage which we thought were very good. Don't book seats in the centre if you can anticipate you will want to get up during the show, as you will have to push past 15-20 people either side of you in a relatively cramped space. Also, I would not recommend sitting too far forward of the theatre, as in some scenes the performers come up the aisles of the Orchestra section and you will not get a good view. The show itself was fantastic and I could not fault it. I myself have not even seen The Lion King on film however I really enjoyed this show and it didn't lose my interest at all for the whole two hours. I would definitely recommend this show a ""must see"" for anyone's visit to New York."	5	5	Very good!	Ben W
183	September 2, 2014	What a fantastic musical presentation. It was superb and Australia will enjoy when it comes down under.	182	5	Love the King	Allan.G49
32	September 2, 2014	It was our first Broadway show and we wanted something that appealed to all four family members. The talent, costumes, music,etc were perfect! What an evening!	16	5	Amazing show!	Ellen H
10	August 31, 2014	This show was spectacular! We went to the box office the day of around 6pm in hopes of cancelations. We scored great seats 5 rows from the stage. It was incredible! The beginning brought me to tears (maybe it was pregnancy hormones!) but it was fabulous. The entire show kept my husband and I enthralled and wanting more. Such talent and creativity. If you see any show, see this one!! If this is your first musical experience, google appropriate etiquette, it's worth the tips and will help everyone have a great experience. 	4	5	A must see!	Tricia S
99	August 31, 2014	A very good show. If you have seen the movie and liked it you will enjoy the show. If you haven't seen the movie (where have you been under a rock?) you will still enjoy the show. 	33	4	Very fun	allenha
12	August 31, 2014	Great Theater, organized staff, and superb show, IT's NEW YORK and it's on Broadway, what could be better?	4	5	AWESOME !!	tinabean25
53	September 1, 2014	had to wait in a reserve queue had rung ahead and was told tickets were available no tickets left when i got there had to pay cash for ticket would not take credit card but was it worth the wait yes yes yes costuming/props/cast all brilliant	18	5	loved the king of the beasts	annielou777
28	August 28, 2014	We absolutely loved this show. We visited at the end of May and thought this was probably the best show we have seen. The atmosphere was brilliant, ant the whole production was 1st class. When in New York this is a must!!!!	23	5	Outstanding performance	Ianrey
262	August 29, 2014	We decided it was worth it to finally go see the Lion King so we flew into New York for the day and fly out that night. The show was well viewed from the balcony seats facing the stage to the left. The show wasn't what I had expected since I for some reason thought it would be a bit 'darker' for lack of a better term, but it was like the movie which is enjoyable. The costumes and the performances were just solid....just a fine show all around. Snack are lacking so either bring some of your own or fill up before attending.	90	4	Flew in for the show	Matt P
56	August 29, 2014	Thoroughly enjoyed our eve at the Theatre having missed Lion King back home. Beautifully done. The puppets / animal costumes were stunning! An expensive eve out but well worth it even if you only do it once!!	28	4	worth a visit	Hallbell
31	August 30, 2014	This has been broadways #1 show for a little while now.The performers are so talented.This was our first New York Broadway show.The music & story are wonderful!	21	5	Loved It! Loved It!	William K
19	August 26, 2014	Booking for Lion King easy on line and good seats available even at fairly short notice. Theatre itself is pretty big. We were on 2nd row of mezzanine and had a great view. Show was great. Only downside was the exhorbitant prices for refreshments. I am aware theatres charge extra, but $35 for one beer a couple of bottles of water and some chocolate nibbles (cant remember exactly what they were) was way over the top. Shame as rest of experience was great	17	4	Brilliant experience but bring your own refreshments if you can	Debsid
19	August 26, 2014	Took my 12 year old to see this show. I had seen it 15 years ago, but it was her first time. It's a great show for kids, but after seeing it once I didn't enjoy it as much the second time. I watched her reactions more anyway. Priceless!	5	4	DD first show	love2garden
52	August 27, 2014	First time I'd seen the show. My wife thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought the set and costumes were well done, and there were contemporary nods in places in the script. Whilst the run time (c.150 mins) felt overly long, the performances were fantastic (especially young Simba and Nala) and they rightly received a standing ovation from the entire theatre.	20	4	You'll have no worries	L0ndonChap
35	August 27, 2014	The real awards here go to the costume designers. Very clever and colorful. The music is good and the acting is fair	8	4	Fun show	GaryD62
26	August 23, 2014	My wife and I have just returned from New York, the highlight being this amazing show. I had managed to get great orchestra tickets before leaving England and we were not disappointed . From beginning to end this show is spectacular. Some of the costumes are just amazing. Souvenirs, drinks etc are reasonably priced, no different to all major cities. The Minskoff Theatre is conveniently situated just off Times Square. Would recommend The Lion King to anyone young or old.	9	5	Wonderful Show	steve_james62
101	August 23, 2014	We took several college students with us to see this production and they were all in 'awe' of the great production. Powerful staging and wonderful costumes and script. 	33	5	What a great show	gov5180
38	August 24, 2014	I went with my 12 years old daughter and really loved the show, the music, the costumes, and the story. We spent an excellent time together, tickets a bit pricy ... but kind of Worth it :)	14	5	Amazing Musical, excellent music, dancers	Daniel B
24	August 25, 2014	I almost cried during the opening number because it was so breathtaking and incredible. The actors were amazing and they did a great job making it not feel strange that they were walking around with puppets and lion heads strapped to their bodies. Sit on thee main level near the aisles if you want a close up view of lost of the animals entering. 	5	5	Absolutely Incredible!	Page T
30	August 19, 2014	A visit to New York would not be complete without attending a Broadway Show so the Lion King was our choice. So we wouldn't miss out, we bought our tickets online and noticed it was a full house on our arrival. The show was above expectation, the cast was excellent and stage props extraordinary. A truly magical atmosphere was experienced by our party of 9. Well worth the money spent!	8	5	Magic on Broadway!	Gina F
6	August 20, 2014	It was wonderful my grandchildren and I loved it.  Restaurants right there for dinner and the area was safe and the show was amazingly wonderful. The dancers and singers and the costumes just made you feel great as you were watching. Not a bad seat anywhere you would sit.	181	5	Worth going to go	Eva154995
50	August 20, 2014	This is one of the MUST attractions in NYC, never miss this show and try to select front seats to enjoy it :)	34	5	Amazing Show	Abdullah A
261	August 22, 2014	My wife got us orchestra tickets for this show since she knows how much I love Lion King. I was certainly not disappointed. The theater is massive, at least for a broadway theater. From the start of the show, I had chills and I was riveted throughout. The set and costume designs are probably my favorite part of the whole show and the story is so well known but I was still thinking the Mufasa storyline would go a different route(sigh). I will definitely come back and see this show. There are so many talented individuals that make up this show, especially rafiqi(in my opinion). It is a must go!!	112	5	Great anniversary gift	Redux27
23	August 19, 2014	There are different styles of theatre, for me this was more than just puppeteering. The artists were all distinguished, the storyline was original and in ways tied into the movie. The young talent was remarkable. If you have the opportunity do go watch the show. However, the age group would be pitched to late teens and older. But be prepared, my only disappointment was the audience, does no one know theatre etiquette crinkling packets in the middle of a performance is a big no no. So if you are easily annoyed find a time and day when people are most likely to stay so you may experience a magical performance.	10	5	Must see!	Ashona S
73	August 19, 2014	The show's designer Julie Taymor is a genius. Through a combination of costume, makeup, puppetry, and clever set design, she is able to transport the audience to the Serengeti plains. Go, just go. Save your nickels and dimes and get your tickets. You'll thank me.	52	5	So glad I went	VaBene001
42	August 19, 2014	I saw The Lion King show for the first time back in 2000 in Toronto and was blown away then. Seeing it in New York 14 years later for the second time, I was just as blown away! The performers and the costumes are just amazing. It's definitely a show the whole family can enjoy and worth the ticket prices. 	23	5	Still the best show I've seen	Ashley E
39	August 19, 2014	This show does all the usual things well - story, music, vocals, acting - but what sets it apart are the incredible costumes and sets. They are able to enhance the story and visually engage and captivate the audience. I went with my teen daughter and we left saying - wow that was like nothing we've ever seen on broadway before.	16	5	inspirational story - breathtaking costumes	suzanne v
4	August 15, 2014	My teenager loved the show! Amazing puppets and costumes. Cast was great. Young Simba and Nala were amazing. 	5	5	NYC	Elizabeth B
20	August 16, 2014	This is a MUST SEE!!!! The musical was amazing. The costumes more than anyone could ask for. The entire show was beyond what I had ever imagined. This musical is for any age child/adult. There will be no disappointements. All the seating is great (we had a person in a wheelchair with us and had great seats) and there isn't a place you can't see the stage well. The 'animals' come down the isles while you are seated to get to the stage. The stage is set up beautifully and efficiently so that nothing is left out and it runs very smoothly. You HAVE to see this show!!	10	5	WOW WOW WOW!	wildangels
10	August 17, 2014	Wow. Well worth the money. Fantastic show and what voices. Still tingle when the initial song starts.  The costumes were amazing.  Would love to go again 	3	5	Brilliant	SilverVoices
8	August 18, 2014	Great family entertainment -music, costumes, dancing everything was extremely well done. Liked the seats and the ability to hear and see performers in the aisles and on stage.	3	5	Well Done	Almc55
88	August 10, 2014	Exceeded our expectations and we were thrilled to have middle of the theater seats at row 7.. Our kids(teens ) loved it and we felt we got our money's worth.	48	5	The Show to See	Dave D
164	August 11, 2014	This is an icon of Broadway and we were not disappointed in the production. However, we will never go to a matinee again! The rude people around us opening noisy candies while we were focused on the dialogue. If you are going, be considerate...EAT before you go! 	41	4	Can't Go Wrong....We thought.	osborner
20	August 11, 2014	Contrary to what most people say, for me it's just plain boring. I didn't take the kids, but if I would have, they'd have arrived to the same conclusion since -to top it off- it's too long.	29	2	Boring; not worth the money	Silvina C
123	August 12, 2014	My eight year old son and I were both very pleased with this performance. While we have seen the animated film previously, the costumes and actors really brought new life to this story. Highly recommend, especially for younger children.	24	5	Very Entertaining	Steven M
231	August 6, 2014	We went here last september, and it was one of the best kids' shows that I have ever seen. My brother loved it.	111	4	Great for kids	Zachary W
15	August 7, 2014	What more needs to be said!! Amazing production great music and a classic story. The front mezzanine is the best seat in the house.	8	5	Amazing Show	Northern B
24	August 8, 2014	Overall it was a good experience, but for $380.00USD for 2 tickets, I was left wanting more. For that price we were far--a little more than half way to the back.  Cons: 1. The theatre is smaller than my nephews classroom. The seats were very uncomfortably small.   I'm not a big woman and it was rather embarrassing. Be prepared to be touching strangers   beside you. If you are 6'0 or over you may want to get the isle seat.  2. The production was rather cheap looking  -lighting was poor  - costumes were cheap 3. $10 for water? #noexcuse Positive:  1. The line moved very quickly and the staff were friendly and helpful 2. The acting was phenomenal 4. The singing was grand The location is great for afterwards. Lots of restaurant and nightlife. The streets were booming.	16	2	Really New York?	Anneka T
16	August 9, 2014	Cast was amazing! Forgot how much I loved the music, and story line. Will look forward to coming back.	16	5	Great night at the Theater.	Leslie S
6	August 4, 2014	Go! Just do it. Spend the extra money and sit up close. I was so moved I literally cried. It was absolutely incredible. I have seen several broadway shows and this one surpassed them all!	3	5	Amazing! Breathtaking! Must see!	Lindsey E
36	August 5, 2014	I did not know what to expect when we got out tickets. This is the best art performance I have ever attended. What a talent and skill shown on stage. Respect!	25	5	Must go!	salehlzeik
7	August 5, 2014	"Amazing musical for all ages. Great costumes, great music, very entertaining, you ""must"" see!!! I saw many shows on Broadway this one is a winner!"	4	5	Best musical!!!	Magda009
3	August 5, 2014	Watching the movie with my daughter when she was growing up and then seeing it live. Incredible! Memories that will last a lifetime.	64	5	BLOWN AWAY	11-17beachdreamer
14	August 1, 2014	The Lion King is a must see show!!! The costumes! The singing/dancing! Everything was sooooooo wonderful!	24	5	THE BEST!	Jennifer R
15	August 2, 2014	It's a once in a lifetime experience! The acting is amazing, the singing is wonderful, the set is awesome, the dancing is incredible, and the costumes are extraordinary! It's also a very funny show. Yes, it is a bit more pricy than most of the other shows, but it is totally worth it! One of the best seats are side balcony, in my opinion.	8	5	Totally worth the money!	1KY_Family
5	August 2, 2014	I'm not big on musicals, and not big on the theatre. But when I saw this, I was blown away. The costumes, stage, acting, singing, dancing and music were outstanding. In short - if you only get to see one show in NYC, see this one. You won't be disappointed.	5	5	Outstanding show	Tim C
201	August 4, 2014	Great show for all ages. The acting, singing, costumes and sets were all outstanding. We were so impressed with the young talent as well. Thoroughly enjoyed the performance...well worth the price!	67	5	Amazing Performance!	Danielle C
280	July 28, 2014	We visited the Minskoff Theatre for the Broadway Lion King performance during our stay in NYC. We absolutely loved every minute in that theatre! All actors and actresses, young or old, were great, and the costumes were nothing short of amazing! We will definitely return to Broadway some day. And if not for this, certainly for another show.	140	5	Wonderful Acting and Choreography!	Gazpacho16
65	July 29, 2014	After years of having this on my bucket list and years of hype about how great it is, we finally made it to NYC to see the show. It was a solid show. The costumes and set are impressive. I may have built it up a little too much in my head because it didn't quite live up to my expectations, but it was definitely worth seeing!	34	4	Great Show!	Kknichols
19	July 30, 2014	Finally had the opportunity to see LION KING. Not disappointed at all - it is as wonderful as so many have said. The performers are amazing - moving puppet strings so gracefully and singing at the same time! Each actor was superb. Words fail me regarding the costumes - they are beyond belief. Everything was truly enchanting.	2	5	A FUN AFTERNOON!	apj70
69	July 31, 2014	"The Lion King is a very good musical and worth the money and the time. Creative solutions with all the animals - you ""almost"" believe that the animals are one the stage. Beautiful music and an overall great performance."	35	4	Broadway did it again	DanishTraveller2009
30	September 11, 2014	Have you seen the video that's gone viral? Of the cast on the train? The experience is 100% better!! Color, music, everything. You HAVE to see it live. You'll forever regret it if you don't.	3	5	Perfection	Sharon B
9	September 14, 2014	This was an absolutely amazing performance. I had goosebumps for the half the show because I was in awe of the songs, costumes, and choreography. Lion King the movie came out when I was young, so it was so cool to see it adapted to the stage in way that kids and adults alike can enjoy it. We sat in the mezzanine, front row just off to the right of center. Word of advice: when choosing your tickets, try to get this area. It was much cheaper that the seats below, and our view was phenomenal. The ticket website lets you choose exactly which seats you want, and if you select the front row seats (the long front row, not the short rows on the sides) just to the sides of the center, they are about $30 cheaper and just as good. Oh, and FYI, the drinks at the concession stand are super expensive, so indulge before you go unless you're ok spending $22 on a shot of liquor with a mixer in a souvenir cup ;)	7	5	AMAZING!!!	puretexan1984
27	September 16, 2014	I was so excited to see this play and it did not let me down. It was beautiful and very emotional. I actually cried with the circle of life number. We loved it.	3	5	Dream come true	Leslie C
155	September 18, 2014	The puppets aren't like those of Sesame Street. They are THE reason this is such an engaging production, although who doesn't love the Father and Son story?	47	5	Puppets you say?	Barbara L
18	September 21, 2014	The artistry in this play is awe inspiring! You will be taken away to another beautiful land of magic!	5	5	For everyone!	Martha L

53	September 29, 2014	an amazing show, perfect length, interactive, great actors however dont worry about getting front row center, we did and it was amazing but it seems like it would be just as good from any seat in the house. definitely worth the money. fun experience. support the arts !	7	4	beautiful	Carlyengleton
48	October 2, 2014	We have seen this show to many times to count- each time we take new people we go and taking our grandkids was our favorite time-! They really outiddpid themselves with this show from the costumes tomthebtars and the music this is a must see for anyone	16	5	See over and over	Julie K
310	October 4, 2014	It's the third time I have been here. It is absolutely fantastic. No other words can describe the magnificence of Lion King. Thank you to all the team.mi will return.	222	5	A must	L F
19	October 7, 2014	Very impressed with production and our great seats - orchestra, 5 rows back! Coming from a small town, the entry to the theatre was impressive - we took lots of pictures on the way in!	20	5	Great seats, great production!	Mary K
94	October 9, 2014	This is the show I have always wanted to see and it didn`t disappoint me at all. It was absolutely amazing!! The costumes, the lights, the characters, the scene...If you go you won`t regret it!	26	5	The best on Broadway!	Carina L
69	October 12, 2014	First time I have seen the Lion King. This show was my first choice of a show to see on Broadway. Loved every minute of it. I laughed, I cried, I was wowed. Outstanding costumes, beautiful performances and a great theatre. 	81	5	What a knock out	Trish4040
112	October 14, 2014	We had seen the musical performance at Disney World Animal Kingdom and had hear the longer version in NYC had great costuming and sets. We were very pleased and really liked the theater itself.	29	5	All we expected of Disney	Bill C
288	October 17, 2014	This was the highlight of our trip. Loved the whole thing, even the shop was not too expensive. Sadly no photographs are allowed. The whole thing was fantastic, could not complain about one thing. Hopefully will see it again when it is on tour. Lots of building work going on around the area.	120	5	10 stars!	msna
16	October 20, 2014	A new high in the use of color- in the costumes and the sets, delightful music and dance and a truly original story - all blended beautifully	4	5	Spectacular !!!	Ron A
13	October 22, 2014	Lion King was amazingly awesome! The performers did an excellent job. The costumes were beautiful & well done. You forget it's people portraying animals. Loved it!!!	5	5	Hear me roar	K B
78	October 23, 2014	This was amazing! First show on Broadway and it was definitely not a let-down. Paid $122 a ticket the day before, seats were high but the view was still good. I would recommend this to anyone!	37	5	INCREDIBLE	Sam H
12	October 23, 2014	Who doesn't love The Lion King? Always entertaining and always well performed. Definitely recommend for all.	2	4	Fun	Skyfan
57	October 24, 2014	Had heard this show is fabulous, but really words do no justice to the show. Its two and a half hours of total entertainment....amazing sets, costumes that one keeps gasping at, fantastic music to support...despite the fact that one has seen the movie a zillion times, the show brings it alive so beautifully. Each character from Mufasa to Simba, Nala, Zazoo....brilliantly put together. A must-do when in NYC :)	19	5	Worth more than every penny spent...	anupmasuneja
15	October 25, 2014	Was lucky enough to have great seats but anywhere in the house would have been good to see this. Both the acting/stageplay and costumes alongside great sets and special effects made this the best theatre musical I have ever watched! 	4	5	Simply Brilliant!	Sean D
6	October 21, 2014	show is excellent. Costumes were wonderful . The music is amazing. It is worth to see . Price is ali it'll bit more but you must see it	7	5	Wonderful	Cengiz C
58	October 21, 2014	Fantastic show, very true to the original movie. Very unique combination of animal and human movements, hard to decide which was more impressive.	16	5	One of the best	Michael B
3	October 22, 2014	Loved everything about it! wanted to see it for years and i was not disappointed! Good little theatre. Choose this as the show to see on your visit.	1	5	Absolutely brilliant!	Victoria M
20	October 22, 2014	I was lucky enough to be given tickets to this show. I went with my husband who isn't particularly into the arts - more of a sports guy, but he LOVED it! He went on and on about how it was so much better than he thought it would be. Great for all ages! It will give you goosebumps!	6	5	Incredbile must-see show!	Kellie B
26	October 18, 2014	So entertaining and riveting that the time flew by. It was perfectly cast by a group of extremely talented actors. This play starts out strong with the opening song and ends with a seemingly flawless performance. The costumes and the choreography were outstanding	13	5	A memorable experience	mary3234
67	October 19, 2014	"What a great show! It's my second to best Broadway musical since I enjoyed the ""Cats"". Music was fantastic and all the cast was brilliant and phenomenal. It's just amazing and unforgettable moments. We all enjoyed the show. I want to watch it again in near future."	20	5	Mama mia	ongoni
70	October 19, 2014	Absolutely fantastic show. Nothing to dislike about any of it. We totally loved it and would recommend to anyone	144	5	fabulous show!	chrisb24
63	October 20, 2014	This was the most wonderful show I have ever seen, watching the people dressed in animal creations walk down the aisles where we were sitting toward the stage was incredible, I actually felt quite chocked up. The singing and costumes were out of this world. An absolute must.	18	5	An experience of a lifetime	kimandco_11
37	October 14, 2014	A fantastic show. Everything the theatre should be, colourful, fun, touching, amazing and tuneful. Our 10 and 7 year olds loved it. The grown ups were bowled over. Just pay the price and go, it is a must.	46	5	Just brilliant	KingOfMoss
3	October 15, 2014	Worth the money--the kids were amazed, and I found the costumes and music to be awe-inspiring. There was nothing I disliked about it.	7	5	Great show	Melissa C
176	October 15, 2014	Hands down, The Lion King is the best Broadway show I have ever seen. Appropriate for children of all ages. The performers dance and sing around the whole theatre, there is not such thing as a bad seat. Everyone should see this show.	50	5	Best. Show. Ever.	KK78
88	October 16, 2014	If you go to New York you have to go to Broadway and see a Musical. Well the lion king is probably one of the best: simply amazing...an unmissable experience	22	5	Amazing	Anna p
6	October 13, 2014	Must see. I loved everything about it!! By far the best Broadway show. It is a great show for all ages. Loved it!	1	5	Amazing	JohnTIII
35	October 13, 2014	This is my first visit to Lion King on Broadway and took my 10 year old daughter to see it for a visit to NYC. It is over the top amazing! I've seen many Broadway shows but this is my favorite with a visit with your child/ren. The costumes are unbelievable. I was in awe of them. The plot does follow the movie exactly and the actors are spot on. It was great to take my younger daughter to a show that was appropriate for her and entertaining for the both of us. A must see !	18	5	Still wonderful and eternal	Kristen S
22	October 14, 2014	Spectacular, thrilling, eye-popping, imaginative beyond belief, incredible stagecraft, voices, performances....The longest running play in the history of Broadway. 'Nuff said.	22	5	Do you need anyone to tell you?	dellavar
15	October 14, 2014	We all know the story. The attraction is the costumes, effects, music and dance in the telling of the story.	18	4	The Lion King	Peggy B
9	October 9, 2014	This was probably the highlight of our trip. This was really an experience which we won't forget for a long time. This show is spectacular-the actors are singers, dancers and acrobats all at once. The customes and makeup are lovely and there is a live orchestra playing during the show. This is really an interactive experience and the actors even come to the audience a few times during the show. Once you see it you will understand why the tickets are expensive. In my opinion, worth every penny, just amazing	1	5	wow	Kapichie
105	October 10, 2014	"This is another amazing show! I saw it when I was in 4th grade (I am in 6th grade now) but I still remember it! The review ""See it now remember it remember it forever!"" Is very right! This is an amazing show with Amazing charectors...You should see this show!"	87	5	This is another Must see Show!	Josh D
8	October 11, 2014	My first Broadway show which my sister in law took me too, which made it so special. Have always loved the story of The Lion King.	23	5	Awesome	Nayha_12
48	October 12, 2014	I saw this years ago w/one of my daughters and my oldest grandson. I was anxious to bring another grandsons because I knew he would enjoy it, and my husband hadn't seen it either. Well, I was so entranced w/the costumes, remembered it so vividly, that seeing it a second time was a waste. Everyone else loved it!	17	5	Genius ... but not a play to see twice.	JudiFran
177	October 8, 2014	As spectacular a show as you will ever see on Broadway. You CAN NOT imagine the creativity that went into telling this story on the stage. Suitable for those from 6-106, and a show that will touch anyone's heart. Worth whatever it costs, and there are plenty of ways to get discount tickets. Don't pay full price, but don't miss it!	45	5	Roaring reviews! Don't miss this!	oldfresno
13	October 8, 2014	One of the amazing thing I see in my life. Fabulous, Fantastic, grandiose. Very impressed with production and my great seat Front Mezzanine B109. It's about 190$. You will return as a kid when you watch Lion King. You cannot take photos during the show. I recommend it to adults before kids! He lives in you <3	1	5	If you told me One Amazing Thing I've Seen or Done in your life, for sure it's The Lion King Broadway	Michel Z
11	October 8, 2014	This was by far my favorite show. The costumes were amazing and the actors moved with fluidity. It was a wonderful night for all of us. One of my friends cried with joy.	3	5	OMG what fun!	Loumose
14	October 9, 2014	For reference..the date I attended was 10/7. I've seen the Lion King on broadway, but not since maybe 2003. I just cannot believe how downhill this show has gone and maybe is just due to it's age, sold out performances....and ease of which it brings in the all mighty dollar. In short the costumes still role the show...but the novelty wears off quickly. The acting and to a large extent the singing was just horrible. I mean...really bad. What used to be a prestigious gig may not just be a starting point for broadway staff? The music was good albeit very loud.  Final thoughts here as I don't want to be cruel: If you have NEVER seen the show either on or off broadway...it would be worth it ONLY if you are bringing children. If you've ever seen it before or aren't bringing kiddos...save your money. On the flip side of the whole disney thing...Aladdin was pretty darn good! Enjoy! PS. Security at the show was horrible. While they act like they are checking bags...they really aren't. Doesn't make me too comfortable in NYC during current times.	16	3	Shocked at the continued raving reviews. Not what it once was for sure!	Marcus S
25	October 5, 2014	It was made as old school theater, so you can see the people wearing black suits behind the fake animals, it is quite refreshing compare to other plays. 	17	4	Old School Broadway	Dafne A
101	October 6, 2014	Some times the show doesn't match the hype. This time the show was simply amazing. The engineering that went into the costumes and props went hand in hand with the story. It is no wonder that it is enjoying 25 years of success.	42	5	lion king	ronald t
33	October 6, 2014	I thoroughly enjoyed The Lion King. The performers were incredible and the costumes, special effects, and the lighting was amazing. I was hooked from the opening act! 	9	5	Exciting	Anita P
197	October 6, 2014	great show for the whole family, only a few blocks away from Times Square, but if you want tickets you must book in advance this show sells out quickly, if you want tickets then plan in advance	389	5	great show	mulgrew
4	October 2, 2014	From the opening number until the end this helluva experience left me breathless, as a fan of theater this was a unique experience and highly recommended for those adults with young hearts trying to look back to old 90's stuff.	35	5	Magic!	Hugo_Ruesga
2	October 3, 2014	Fabulous show with great costumes and music. The theatre is lovely and dinner before hand at Hard Rock Cafe added to the whole Broadway experience.	1	4	Great night out	JosephineA204
27	October 3, 2014	One of the most amazing things that I've ever seen! That kind of experience you'll never forget. Go and enjoy it!	21	5	The most amazing musical ever!	Ricardo M
63	October 3, 2014	This is an amazing experience.  From the first moments of the performance to the standing ovation we were totally captured by this awesome show. There were a couple of unfamiliar songs in the show that lagged behind the better know ones.  All of the cast are very accomplished singers and the 2 child actors continually stole the show along with Zazu, Pumbaa and Timon. The stampede scene was amazing. This show is a must see on any visit to New York City.	27	5	Sensational Experience	Oldsk8r
22	September 30, 2014	This was one show that we have wanted to see for years, and NY was the only chance we had. Our expectations were high as the music written by Sir Elton John was a favourite of both my late father and ourselves. We were not disappointed! Both the music, costumes and the actors were fantastic. 	5	5	Great show - great music	Mike H
43	September 30, 2014	Disney Magic Comes to Life! Enjoyed by kids and adults! Everything was magical. I could not believe how real the characters were! Go see it!	28	5	A MUST SEE	Brightskin
155	October 1, 2014	Visiting Time Square for the first time, I wasn’t going to miss on my experience to see a show at Time Square. We were lucky as we were able to book the day before for the Lion King. Of course tickets aren’t cheap… the total for both of us was 400$ for tickets in the Orchestra. However, this is Broadway and you can expect to pay the price to see a show there. And frankly, they know how to do it! You would think that only young kids and their parents attend such a show, being a Disney Production, but that’s not the case at all. There are people of all ages and the show is simply spectacular. I love the way they designed the costumes, so that the audience can see the face of those playing the characters. At first, however, it took me a while to focus on the characters rather than strictly on the face of the performers. This is well done, particularly as we get a chance to associate easily who’s who. That night, the role of young Sinba was played by Isaiah D. Negron… what a performance! Bravo! Same thing with the role of young Nala who was played by K’Lynn Jackman… another great performance! Of course all of the actors (Natalie Turner, Thandazile Soni, Gareth Saxe, Jeffrey Kuhn, Alton Fitzgerald White, Chondra La-Tease Profit, etc.) are extremely good, but I was not expecting such a performance by these two kids! While Zazu made me laugh a lot (performed by Jeffrey Kuhn), Scar (Gareth Saxe) made me hate him for his villain spirit! All that to say that you really get into the story… thanks to all the performers! As well, the music and lyrics are written by Elton John. I just couldn’t resist getting a CD (20$) as the music is beautiful. When you do so, the CD pocket also includes a DVD of the Making of Lion King, so that’s good money invested. In addition, the orchestra is playing live under the direction of Karl Jurman. Great job to all the musicians! The show lasts 2 hours with a break of 15 minutes. We went on a Wednesday night at 7:00 p.m. and the theater was full. We decided to go for a bite only after, so we did not have to rush, and knowing that restaurants were closing late anyway. If you wonder about a show to attend in Time Square, this is the show. After seeing it, I understood how it became the #1 Show in the Broadway! Don’t miss out on it!	163	5	Excellent Show and great performers!	ManonSimard-Canada
1	October 1, 2014	Excellent sets, acting and phenomenal costumes. Our only complaint was that some lyrics were totally drowned out by the orchestra.	1	4	Music too loud	Lynda V
24	September 27, 2014	Great location, Disney story, cast, music, family entertainment. My daughter loved it!. I'd love to get the sound track. A must see!	6	5	Hakuna matata	cuauvallejo
106	September 29, 2014	The Lion King will win your heart with its creative sets and costumes, timeless story and heartfelt performances. The actors voices are fantastic and we saw it again even though we had seen it a few years ago. We really enjoyed it this time too.	21	5	What a delightful show!	WorldView2
22	September 29, 2014	the lion king was one of the Best shows that I have seen in NYC it stands by it's name as the Longest running show. the costumes and singing voices wowed us	16	5	Best show	Patricia3050
39	September 29, 2014	One of the best, if not the best musicals I have ever seen! Go to the box office in the theatre in the morning and get tickets, you won´t regret it.	12	5	Unbelieveable!	Petri L
22	September 25, 2014	The Lion King had great costuming, great dancing, and great choreography . The theater was a bit small a larger theater would have made for a more comfortable environment 	12	5	Awesome costumes	Wendy H
26	September 26, 2014	If you have yet to see The Lion King on Broadway...GO!!! You will not regret it. I've seen it twice and it is worth every penny. The show is spectacular.	23	5	The best Broadway show ever!	Love2TravelDoU
3	September 26, 2014	The Lion King is supposed to be the “landmark musical event of Broadway”. I saw The Lion King in 2009 and it was breathtaking. However this time (September 2014), I felt unhappy and disappointed. The performances lacked feeling. Also the production cut some of the fun parts of the show, and decided to stay with all the dramatic and tragic ones. The staging and costumes were still impressing. Yet, that's not enough. If a show does not have good acting, then all the rest is worthless. The Lion King is not roaring as strong as it once did.	1	2	It has decayed	Andres L
192	September 27, 2014	This was the only show we saw in New York and it was fantastic, the costumes alone are worth going to look at. A fantastic performance. Nothing to dislike at all.	91	5	Fabulous Show!	Mike B
2	September 22, 2014	Awesome play. Great set up, music, costumes and ambiance. Loved it! I do really recommend it.  Awesome play. Great set up, music, costumes and ambiance. Loved it! I do really recommend it. 	2	5	Awesome	C M
41	September 23, 2014	Absolutely wonderful show! This was our first broadway musical and it met / exceeded all expectations. With TA help, we chose the front row seats on the mezzanine - cost about $520 for 3 seats.  No doubt a great experience !	52	5	Great show ! - our first Broadway Musical...	KatoMumbai
5	September 24, 2014	So, I took my new wife to the Lion King in NYC for our honeymoon and her 30th birthday. I am not one for musicals or plays. Aside form the Lion King, I probably would only see The Book of Morman; simply because of Matt Stone and Trey Parker. So to paint a picture, I am more of a Boston Bruins season ticket holder than a theater enthusiast. But, I will say this, The Lion King exceeded any and all expectations I had. The acting was phenomenal. The production value was unreal. The little kid playing Simba will make you question where you were at that age. They even made relevant and current jokes, which means they constantly adapt and perfect the show. Either way, if you are hesitant to see a Broadway show, because it's not your style .... then do not fear The Lion King. It would be very hard to not enjoy it. 	12	5	Amazing!!, from a non theatre goer	Mark B
74	September 25, 2014	I was so impressed by the play, I even cried! Very colorful and lively. My (hard to stay on the seat) daughter stayed glue to the play for the 2 1/2 hours of the show, so that was impressive! The show is absolutely amazing, I have no words to describe the beauty, the voices, the customes... just amazing	29	5	AWESOME	Viri G
12	September 19, 2014	I booked for the Lion King 4 rows from the stage on the aisle. I thought since my hubby and I had never been to Broadway we needed to splash out on an experience we both valued. This show is an African extravaganza!!!! We were in tears in the opening act and we were completely absorbed by the show. The acting, singing, costume design, stage design, directing & producing is spectacular!!! Don't second guess yourself, just book!!! Our seats were perfect too!!!! Congratulations to all who are involved in this masterpiece!!!	6	5	Incredible, Breathtaking, African Dream	Travellerforlife9
283	September 20, 2014	Great story, great performers and very visual with excellent costumes and performers use the entire theatre. Limited restroom capacity especially for women. Located right by Times Square so it can be nice to walk around Times Square after an evening show. 	94	5	Fantastic Show	Renaissanceman58102
43	September 21, 2014	My husband and I were in dispute over which show to go to as it was our first time on Broadway. I had wanted to see Phantom and he the Jersey Boys, so we compromised with the Lion King! Neither of us were disappointed, we thought it was a very polished and professional production with amazing costumes. We loved the interaction with the audience, the beautiful singing and wonderful acting. It was moving and yet surprisingly funny too, with some great 'one liners'! You will not be disappointed as most of us know the story of Simba, and here it's been beautifully reproduced for the theatre.	118	5	Amazing	DorsetCrab
112	September 21, 2014	Fab theatre, we were 3 rows from back with an amazing view, drinks were $16!!! But got to keep the lion king cup. The show was wonderful, amazing singing and acting and the costumes and puppetry out of this world. Highly recommended 	56	4	Beautiful	FifiD11
202	September 16, 2014	Yes, it's that good. It's just so very, very good. Uplifting. Joyful. Fun for everyone, regardless of age. I took my kids. I took my mom. I took myself. I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it. Go see it. Money well spent. MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 	110	5	I Have Seen it Three Times and Could See it Again	Beautyhuggeranonymous
76	September 17, 2014	This is a show for the whole family, we had box tickets $99 each and they were excellent. The colours, singing, costumes, acting, music and stage designed is wonderful.	17	5	Amazing	Kathleen25Feb
17	September 17, 2014	Nothing to dislike about this place! Great experience. Lovely show & memorable, will come back for more.	4	4	Great!	Virna C
42	September 18, 2014	I had watched this musical before, but I think it never looses its charm. I treat for kids and grown-ups!	45	5	Always magical	Juliana V
30	September 14, 2014	This show is worth seeing for the costumes alone. The theatre was very comfortable with lots of leg room and they allowed drinks to be taken to the seats	15	5	Brilliant show!	Jean G
51	September 15, 2014	We enjoyed the Lion King very much. Colourful oranges and yellows, lovely music and fantastic animals. You have to see them to believe them. Don't miss it. (Staff at the theatre box office could do with learning to be polite and smile)	33	5	Colourful	gill.e
60	September 16, 2014	I was told by many to see this show. After having the experience myself, I would recommend anybody to watch it, whether you were a fan of the movie or not. I scored some tickets last-minute, which put us at the very top and last row, but I was not disappointed. The performances and sets were breath-taking. I was in awe by the entire thing and I would see it again if invited. If you want a good show to see, I would definitely say this is the one.	26	5	One of the best shows I've ever seen	Yasmin W
4	September 16, 2014	I went with adult friends and we all loved it! It is great for children as well. This is another show which is worth seeing multiple times.	52	5	Loved It!	LuckyDulce
9	September 12, 2014	Loved it!!! This is our second time to see this play . Wonderful actors and actresses. It's a wonderful play for all ages. 	3	5	New York 2014	Stephanie H
20	September 12, 2014	We sat in row 3 of the Orchestra section and the performers come right by you. The only issue is that you can't see the floor. Other than that, we really enjoyed it.	10	5	Awesome performance!	Leroy Z
6	September 12, 2014	The show was fantastic! Definitely recommend and would go see again. Amazing to watch how the scenes can change so quick. The talent was amazing.	36	5	Awesome!	Nadine W
93	September 13, 2014	It was difficult to decide which show to see, but we made the right choice with the Lion King.From the very start I was mesmorised! The set was unbelievable, costumes beyond imagination, atmosphere electric, singing inspiring. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up at times. It is probably the best musical I have ever seen - and I am 62! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Simply Amazing.	44	5	AMAZING	Irishflojo
64	October 26, 2014	Triple fun last night in front row seats - great show - enjoyed very much . Not a musical masterpiece a terrific show and a must to see	28	5	Fun Fun Fun	Jakartarobert

28	November 1, 2014	A spectacular show in a lovely theatre with comfortable seating. The staff personally show you to your seats - a nice touch! Have waited a long time to see this and it certainly did not disappoint.	17	5	Terrific	Lyn B
3	November 3, 2014	The set was totally unbelievably wonderful. The music was great. We really had a nice evening. I liked that the actors came around through the aisles. You never quite new what to expect- very fun.	1	5	A roaring good time...	Patricia W
104	November 4, 2014	We went to this show with our 8 year old girl. Thhe show was amazing, very professional and we spent a wonderful time. We did not see the 2 and half hours passing. We were very well seated in front row and we had a very good view on the scene. The stage costume were just beautiful with wide varieties and staging extremely well prepared and imaginative. The theater is easy to get into and nice.	38	5	awesome show	Sabine K
46	November 4, 2014	This is one of the most beautifuls musicals I've ever seen. I went with no expectations and I was surprised . Please go and see it !	15	5	AMAZING	Paularenaca
80	November 8, 2014	Performances - outstanding. Costumes - magnificent. Staging and Puppetry - unparalleled. Best show on Broadway - undoubtedly. If you can only see one show on Broadway, this is the one. First show I ever saw on Broadway almost 17 years ago and a few weeks ago - still my favorite. It is thrilling, exciting, and memorable.	62	5	The Best of Broadway	smholst
30	November 10, 2014	These is a great show and really recommend it but you need to book early to get good seats. We had great seats Mezzanine Row A 122 to 126 and if available would recommend these.	41	5	Lived up to everything	Williamsver
58	November 12, 2014	Quite a spectacular production, with the costumes and musicals. My two small children were totally into it. No issue of losing interest during the show. Really quite entertaining for adults as well as children. Highly recommended.	27	5	If you have kids, this is THE show to see	Shannon B
15	November 16, 2014	Amazing music, amazing costumes, amazing talent. Amazing. Period. There's a reason why this is one of the most succesful musicals of all time! Adults and children (quiet, respectable children, unlike the ones that were sat behind me during the performance I saw!) would love this spectacle.  A must-see for any Broadway lover!	3	5	One of the best for a reason!	Chels333
74	November 19, 2014	"I can't recommend this production enough. It was, by far, the most amazing thing that I've seen in a long time. From the first song on, this show will have you captivated. The way the animals are created, and the way they move, is so real. There was a Cheetah, who didn't have a ""starring"" role, but every time she hit the stage I couldn't take my eyes off her. Her movements were so real! I would watch this show again, and again, and again. Go see it now!"	32	5	Amazing, simply amazing	Kelly O
58	November 23, 2014	I've seen this show three ways. Portions of it at Disneyworld, the complete show in Toronto, and at Times Square. The presentation in both Toronto and Florida were better in my opinion than the one at times square. It may be that it was just a bit more serious interpretation than I remember. We also went to Aladdin and thought that was an exceptional show if you want something lighter and funnier.	36	3	Good show but.....	wetravelalot4fun
27	November 27, 2014	Brilliant and well worth watching. Performances by all were superb as you would expect. Not cheap for good seats. 	20	5	Excellent	Trimsaran_56
4	December 1, 2014	My husband took me to see this for my birthday while in NYC. It was my 1st ever broadway show and I didnt know what to expect. It was AMAZING, i had gossebumps from the opening scene, loved it!	1	5	A Feast for the eyes	LoisS57
8	December 2, 2014	Must see this show. Kids and adults will enjoy it. Its amazing. The scenario, the actors, the costumes and dances and singing. Worth to see if looking for a Broadway Show.	8	5	Best Show on Broadway	Jenny B
5	December 3, 2014	The best musical we have ever seen. We were slightly concerned about the price of the tickets, but soon forgot that. It was original and funny. 	2	5	Amazing	Rachel G
21	December 5, 2014	This show did not disappoint it was fantastic from start to finish, the cast were brilliant the music everything was perfect and well worth the money, the theatre was a good size not too big, and it was well organised entering and leaving the building - go to this show you will not be disappointed.	21	5	Brilliant show	joeandem
36	December 5, 2014	We took our 6 year old son and he sat on the edge of his seat the entire time. The costumes were indescribably beautiful and amazing! I can't recommend this play enough!	8	5	Awesome!!!!!	Angela H
82	December 6, 2014	Impressive costuming, dance, sets and creativity. Went to the 8:00pm performance. If you go, get there after 7:30 so you dont have to stand in line outside. Since you get assigned seats, no advantage to going early. Theater has great acoustics.	38	4	Really different	Janet S
34	December 6, 2014	The costumes were the best part of this musical. The actors came into the audience several times throughout the performance. The music was great and the acting top notch. A must see!	12	5	Everyone of every age should see this show	Hotel_Lady
6	December 6, 2014	you will want to see it again.it was a great show for all ages, great costumes great music great location new York city broadway	2	5	must see	EGGSTASY
3	December 3, 2014	I have seen this show twice now and it is AMAZING! I highly recommend it! My husband and I went over Thanksgiving to NYC and I told him we definitely had to see this show! 	5	5	The Lion King	eg0220
20	December 3, 2014	best show i have ever seen . the music, vocasl and experience of the actors and the outstanding pupett creations was like nothing we had ever witnessed .	8	5	aaaaammmmmaazzing	BelfastWoodsy
12	December 3, 2014	First saw Lion King maybe 6 years ago. Decided to see again on a recent trip. Wonderful, timeless music and story with incredible animatronics as the characters come to life.	4	4	Can't miss a classic	David M
26	December 4, 2014	Words can't describe. Beautiful costumes, sets and lighting. I saw a hyped Broadway show a few years ago, that I actually fell asleep on due to boredom. This one definitely lives up to the hype.	15	5	Breathtaking	Riley D
33	December 2, 2014	"What a delightful show! I saw ""The Lion King"" with my son, daughter-in-law, and 3 grandsons; ages 10, 8, & 5 on Nov 15, 2014. It was a perfect play to see for all ages. The music and costumes were fabulous. Just seeing the 'animals' was special. Entertaining and many talented actors make it a show to put at the top of your list."	14	5	Great Show for Young & Old	KathleenCT
19	December 2, 2014	The Lion King was one of the best theater shows. The costumes are beautiful. Music was moving and funny. We had a range of ages watching from 9, 45, 50 and 73. It was equally enjoying to all.	5	5	Want to see it again....	volley911girl
16	December 2, 2014	Was amazing. . . loved the quip about Frozen- unexpected & made everyone giggle! Took the entire family- parents & 3 college students.	13	5	Circle of life	cmmomtoo
4	December 2, 2014	So I was in charge of putting together a group to go see this wonderful show in the middle of the winter! We weren't sure if the show that night was going to be cancelled due to the 3 feet of snow on the ground that had just fallen overnight, so the twenty of us stayed by the phone and watched the 24 hr. news channel. Lo and behold, not only did the show go on, but we made it in, snow and all! And it was FABULOUS!	1	5	The FABULOUS Lion King	Mambosyl
84	December 1, 2014	Brilliant. Convenient location. When the show was finished we were treated to the street entertainment on Times Square 	34	5	Awesome show	Sandy R
11	December 2, 2014	Absolutely brilliant. The production was speechless throughout, every iconic moment and song was performed above my expectation.	11	5	Exceptional!	James M
9	December 2, 2014	One of the best shows i have ever seen. The costumes are amazing and the way the entire show comes together. Highly recommended. Music is fantastic. A must see.	6	5	great production	artiecRocklandCounty
22	November 29, 2014	I've seen it at least 6 times over the past 12 years and its different each time. It is worth it and kids and adults alike will enjoy it. 	12	5	Always Great	IngridNF
15	December 2, 2014	One word.....DISNEY!! Everything and I mean everything they touch turns to gold. From their theme parks to the cruise line, and this play. They spare no expense in making your experience the best. The Lion King may be a pricey show to see but it is worth every penny once you see the smiles on your children's faces. The acting and musical numbers are memorable and the story is timeless. If you are looking for a nice outing for the family I would wholeheartedly recommend this great show. Plus afterwords you can take a short walk to the crossroads of the world and yet again see your children's faces light up in Times Square.	39	5	Best night with the Kids in a long time!	NY1LOU
15	November 29, 2014	This show was my favorite on Broadway so far. The costumes are incredible. The show keeps you in awe from beginning to end. I would most certainly come back to this show. Perfect for all ages! 	8	5	Amazing	Lauren S
13	November 29, 2014	If you've never been book a floor seat now and enjoy. The show is just simply amazing and helps for a no brained date night	5	5	perfect	Vijay K
126	November 30, 2014	Is there anything else to say:) Expensive - but worth it - It is amazing to see this show on Broadway 	13	5	Lion King on BROADWAY	urgent78
19	November 24, 2014	This show was AMAZING!!! My friend and I sat in the second row of the Mezzanine and the cast were very entertaining and it was easy to hear what was being said or sung. The puppets were INCREDIBLE!!! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND seeing THE LION KING if you are visiting NYC as it is highly entertaining.	3	5	Excellent Show	GoyenE567
7	November 25, 2014	I had seen this before in Dublin but the husband hadn't, so we decided to splash out a bit and treat us to this show - being on a honeymoon we didn't want to go for something too sad like Les Mis or Phantom, nor too cynical like Book of Mormon, although that was tempting too. Lovely show as usual, and we were able to get tickets the day before at nearly the base price (they start at 80$, we got them for 89$ each). One star away from excellent just for that - for a show that has been running almost every day for so many hears in a theatre with such a large capacity, I would have hoped that they could offer a wider variety of prices with cheaper options (yes I know, the production costs, etc, but still). Tip: go get the tickets in person and avoid the 10$ per ticket online booking fee.	4	4	Lovely honeymoon treat :)	ElenaIreland82
34	November 25, 2014	This show was the highlight of my 4 day trip to NYC. The seats we had in the mezzanine were great, I could see everything perfectly. The performances were amazing, every character was phenomenal and the props and puppets were beautiful. 	20	5	Highlight of the trip!	Tabs_Daisy
17	November 26, 2014	The scenery, the sets, the voices - everything about the production was first class. From the opening number which brought tears to my eyes, to the ad lib of 'Let it Go' in the second half, to the tears brought to my eyes at the end, I thoroughly enjoyed The Lion King. This show was not on my list of things to do, but I loved it.  I realize this is a family show and that it's a perfect introduction to Broadway theater for children. Parents: please teach your children to clean up after themselves. This beautiful theater was covered with drink cups, candy wrappers, etc. Yes, Disney has people on hand to pick up after your kids. However, it's truly your responsibility to teach them manners. 	5	5	Spectaculor	oohlolla
4	November 19, 2014	The show was fantastic, especially the music, costumes and scenery. I would recomend it for children and adults alike. 	2	5	The highlight of our trip	Veronica G
160	November 21, 2014	Pretty good performance, great seats in centre if row A on the mezzanine. The child actors were brilliant and very obviously enthusiastic! Some of the adult actors appeared to be just going thru the motions (hence four stars not 5).	50	4	Good show	Ajwatty79
51	November 20, 2014	went with my 7 and 10 year old kids, we all loved it, it is beautiful, poetic, powerful. the music is beautiful, the actors incredibly good. the kids enjoyed every moment of it.	26	5	magic at its best	valibulle
129	November 22, 2014	The show is masterfully put on stage with wonderful costumes and a great cast. The story is pretty much the same as the movie, but the audience is still surprised by the wonderful costumes and small twists to the dialogue. Overall a great night!	44	4	Just like the movie, a great show for the whole family!	eli_puszkar
4	November 17, 2014	I would defenitely recommend this show to kids and even to adults. It makes me feel my heart is young again like children. The songs and overall presentation is excellent.	2	5	love it!	Avamfy
19	November 18, 2014	My daughter (13) is a big fan of the Lion King and listens to the Broadway soundtrack often. She was in awe of the costumes, the story and the set design. The theatre is beautiful and the seating was comfortable with plenty of leg room in the mezzanine. We were in row A, seats 125-127 dead center. One of the ushers (older female) directing people at the entrance of the mezzanine was very abrupt/rude when we were entering. Then she repeated shone her flash light toward our section during the show. It was very disruptive. The constant shine from her flash light was startling as you tried to take in the story. Otherwise, great show and the cast was wonderfully talented!	10	5	My daughter loved it!	seagull88
73	November 18, 2014	Great show, great songs, nice roomy theatre. just a good spectacle all round really. We bought mid priced tickets in advance. there werent any discounts we could find, such a popular show i suppose.	22	5	Great show	Andrew C
203	November 18, 2014	You can understand why this show has been so successful for 20 years.  The costumes were absolutely amazing, and really helped with believing you were watching an animal kingdom. The actors in the show were just wonderful, the singing and overall performance really made the show that much better. Highly recommend.  Highly recommend	47	5	Amazing show!	Annafjordan
27	November 12, 2014	Music and singing was awesome, costumes were amazing and the stage special effects were unlike anything I've ever seen. This was actually my first time in New York and my first time being a guest at a live Broadway production so I’m probably not going to be the best critic. Be sure to arrive early. This theatre threatened to lock us out even though we arrived 5 minutes early which I don’t blame them for. The ushers really take keeping the theatre distraction free during the performance serious. I probably would not suggest sitting in the balcony. If you can afford the extra dollars please get the ground level seats. (You will be glad you did) What I can say is that I had fun. I laughed and nearly cried throughout some of the acts. Just an overall Great Show!!!	18	5	Great Show!!!!!	Kevin H
68	November 13, 2014	We have seen the play twice and each time we were mesmerized. This time we simply sank down in our seats and drank in the entire experience. I do not know why but the play makes you feel as if you are interactively involved. They way the costume master(s) created the life of the jungle..the animals is nothing short of FANTASTIC! 	14	4	OMG what a spectacle in theater!	M C G
105	November 13, 2014	Great cast , lovely show for all the family. no discount tickets for this one Broadway show, it's the only one that stays at full price. 	31	5	15 years and still strong	smee4u
22	November 14, 2014	Lots of energy, brilliant songs, performers polished. Minskoff Theatre comfortable and good view of stage from all seats. we were on the mezzanine which was good when the performers were in the audience.	40	5	Excellent production	odonjo
487	November 10, 2014	Brought my nieces and have to say that I enjoyed it as much as they did. Great family show. If you liked the movie, this is a must see!	162	4	Loved it!	Skych8ser
37	November 11, 2014	We went with our kids (10 and 11), they slept almost an a hour, maybe is too long and they were tired because we went at night. 	12	3	Not to good for kids	Michbain
23	November 11, 2014	Amazing performance. What a start to our New York holiday! Really enjoyed it, we had tickets in row P but fantastic view.	6	5	Fantastic	Alison W
140	November 11, 2014	Incredible play, since the beginning you are trapped with the music, the customs the stage. It was one of the best experiences in Manhattan. Recommended to very one, no matter the age, incredible piece you won’t regret to watch.	29	5	We enjoyed a lot the play	Jonathan F
63	November 8, 2014	I'd wanted to go since I was 5, and now I'll go every year that it's open while I live here. Nothing beats the Lion King.	21	5	Just do it.	thelivingroyal
83	November 8, 2014	Great production, wonderful costumes, good casting. We enjoyed the play and the costumes. The drinks are way overpriced and not mostly fruit juices. 	39	5	Great production	Anna B
49	November 9, 2014	Worth every penny!  The opening scene set the bar so high- it was amazing!!! but the rest of the show lived up to this too!  Fantastic show, stunning visuals and the cast have superb voices! definitely recommend this show- it's not just for kids 	12	5	Fantastic show!	Jemma V
165	November 9, 2014	I went with my family to this show. We all really enjoyed it! Great costumes, lighting, sound, acting etc. Not cheap to go but we thought it was great.	38	5	Wow	TheRobertsons43
55	November 5, 2014	"While agreeing that not all of the songs were that memorable and it was mainly about the costumes and sets, we had no complaints, for this was exactly what we expected and wanted (we saw several other types of plays as well: a drama, two smaller musicals that had ""deeper"" meaning, etc.) - an all-out big Broadway musical extravaganza. The rousing audience responses during most numbers showed we were not alone in our assessment. If you are planning a trip to NYC and especially if you have children who have never seen a Broadway musical, you will not be disappointed!"	34	5	A true Broadway Musical Experience	logan03
10	November 6, 2014	This broadway show was quite a big let down for me, perhaps because it was over hyped in my mind. I guess another reason why I couldn't enjoy it much was because I am used to watching Bollywood movies - so I didn't find something spectacularly different and that too at such a steep price. Yes, tickets for Lion King never go on discount not even for Employees of certain companies. Hence, you shell out a huge amount - which further raises expectation levels. I was lucky that I was able to purchase $160 ticket 2 day before...sheer luck, all my friends who saw in the same show had to shell $200+...and of course I am talking of Mezzanine rows. Perhaps, if booked in advance, some ticket prices would soften a bit, but being a classical, not much of a difference. Recommend to go for other classicals: Phantom of Opera, etc. which also go on discounts!	3	3	Over-rated	ScofieldG
27	November 7, 2014	If there is a window in the one year resevation then do go. ten years ago before smartphones were the new fantastic thing in the city, the Lion King was the sweetest. Great Colors, Great singing and dancing. Great effects. But now? Or maybe again I may be older and have outgrown this.	6	5	lovely lovely	Adadeleon
26	November 7, 2014	If go to NY, no doubt go to see this Broadway Show. Incredible! It's not Comparable to Ny other show. Fully recommended	12	5	Best Theatre Ever	Samsung39
117	November 4, 2014	"I saw this many years ago when it first opened. At the time I sat way up in the mezzanine. I always promised myself I would come back and sit in the orchestra on the aisle to see the march of the animals opening number up close. Finally went back and I was very disappointed. They trimmed the cast significantly, and it really shows in the ensemble numbers and opening. Its still a good show, but not as good as it once was. If you take small children, remember that the ""daddy"" dies, and prepare them for it. It can be very scary to a child."	38	3	Much better before it downsized	Foodie P
52	November 4, 2014	The imagination and creativity that went into this show is beyond compare. The musical numbers are delightful and the story is timeless. Not to be missed!	20	5	The Pride of Broadway	Aikivisitor
25	November 4, 2014	A nice experience, but not as great as I expected based on the other reviews. Wish I would have chosen a different show.	8	3	Was enjoyable	Bill_C_Martin_CPA
16	November 4, 2014	We loved the whole thing...the casting was great..music wonderful...costumes unbelievable! We sat on the aisle down near the front...we could have reached out and touched some of the animals as they came down the aisle!	6	5	Don't miss The Lion King!	Betsy K
81	November 3, 2014	My son, who currently lives/works in South Africa was home for a visit Neither he nor his girlfriend had seen this play so we went in., Amazing dancing and music. The props and costumes are cleverly made to depict the animals...giraffes, hyena's etc. The circle of life is well -demonstrated here!!	23	4	Out of Africa	cynbyn1433
4	November 3, 2014	Your money is well spent on seeing this show! It is a theatrical experience of a lifetime! You will be spellbound from the first 30 seconds of the opening till the finale! It would be a great experience for children and adult alike!	2	5	Awesome Show!!!	Barbara2546
139	November 3, 2014	A must see again and again, for young and old, the costumes, the music and the atmosphere is second to none! A Lovely theatre and a fantastic experience 	78	5	One if the best shows ever	louisegough5936
40	November 3, 2014	If you were a Lion King fan as a kid, this show is for you. Growing up, Lion King was huge in our household. We would watch it at least once a day for months, the soundtrack would be playing in the car on our way to school, it's safe to say we had an unhealthy obsession with Lion King. The first thing that really grabbed my attention was the styling of the cast. It was done so meticulously and creatively. The production on stage was impressive. I was waiting to see how they would recreate the Serengeti feel on stage and they nailed it. The acting was good and the music was (I'm bias to this) amazing. It is definitely child friendly, if you want to take your kids and share the Lion King experience with them! 	16	5	A classic	RIM88
104	November 2, 2014	Good modern theatre, friendly staff and excellent production - have seen in London and this was better in some ways 	45	5	Great Show	niftyatfifty
247	November 2, 2014	Great vocals, fantastic costuming, well staged. Tickets are still very pricey. Not really a bad seat in the house, but center stage front mezzanine is awesome!	81	5	Great show, lives up to the hype	dancinggoats
14	November 3, 2014	This is one amazing production. The costumes and sets are unbelievable....beautiful! And the music is awesome. Very enjoyable for adults as well as children. The theater is not very large so any seat isn't crazy far from the stage.	4	5	a feast for the eyes and ears!	coc60745
87	November 3, 2014	"It was an amazing and colorfull show, the songs and ritms are very fun to hear and we had a good time in there. It's a "" must see "" in New York City."	14	4	Very good	Andre Ricardo H
91	October 30, 2014	"Words alone can not describe how spectacular The Lion King is...,you'll laugh, you'll cry...,you'll forget to breathe....,for all the right reasons! Absolutely amazing from start to finish. This should be on everyone's ""bucket list""! Thank you - Broadway! "	42	5	You may just cry...,it's that beautiful!!!	CJBCAB76
9	October 31, 2014	Front row seats! Brilliantly done! I love Timeon and Pumbaa. They were hilarious. They costumes were amazing! Absolutely recommend	1	5	Fab show!	Megan M
28	October 31, 2014	We took our 9 year old grandson to see The Lion King and it was a wonderful experience for all of us. The costumes are amazing. The play, the actors, the music were all wonderful. It was our grandson's very first Broadway play and it definitely left a lasting impression on him. It was a total experience he will never forget. I would definitely recommend this play for all ages.	8	5	Great for all ages	GaiLeonard
109	October 31, 2014	A fantastic show. Never been to one before and so chose one with lots of costumes and animation: antelopes, elephants, giraffes etc and wasn't disappointed. Singing superb. When booking thought it was rather costly $150 each for 2 hours 30 mins but definitely worth it. Very warm in theatre dont think there was any air conditioning.	27	5	"Just simply ""brilliant"""	Janet S
65	October 26, 2014	We managed to get tickets last minute, so our seats were in the second row from the back, but it didn't matter. The show was amazing and we could hear and see everything perfectly fine. The songs, the costumes, the way animals were brought to life- was great. I've wanted to see this musical for a very long time and was not disappointed- it was amazing and well worth the money.	33	5	Amazing	Pomidori
25	October 27, 2014	This was the most amazing experience for me and my son. We loved it.... Once you have been to a show on Broadway you are a fan for like of a Broadway show. Would recommend this experience  to anyone with or with out kids. Amazing 	6	5	Amazing	Rosetta K
51	October 27, 2014	If you're making a trip to NYC, try to get tickets to see The Lion King! It is spectacular! The acting, music, stage design, costumes, are a feast for the eyes and ears -- and emotions. We (my teenage daughter and I) had front row mezzanine seats, and the view was terrific. A great way to spend an evening in NYC and the theatre is right at Times Square!	24	5	A Spectacular Show!	DiscerningTraveler12
153	October 28, 2014	This was my first experience in a real Broadway show, and couldn't choose a different plan or place to take my sisters, who are big fans of The Lion King the movie. The show started off in a very spectacular way. We had the seats next to the alley, so we got the cast walk next to us. Was just amazing. It's exactly like the movie, with additional songs that will take your heart away. There were very emotional scenes, and the cast where just too good. A must see show .... DO NOT miss it if you are in NYC.	48	5	Best show ever!	Jo S
89	December 7, 2014	Costumes were fantastic! Fun and enjoyable for kids. Our kids loved it and we thought it was fun too. 	113	5	Great for families	SBAdvisor
98	December 10, 2014	During a past visit to Disney World, we had attended a scene from the musical and wanted to see the full production. Great show and if you have children, bring them, all will enjoy it!	19	5	Disney Magic	Jim1008
14	December 14, 2014	Having seen it previously at home it was great to see it on Broadway! The theatre is right in centre of Times Square so easy to find. The Performers were immaculate, their little added jokes provided so local colour. Well worth going to see.	5	5	Always amazing	Pen C
7	December 17, 2014	Can only describe as brilliant - story, music, singing and costumes - it was all a phenominal performance	3	5	The not to be missed experience	GarStone
56	December 20, 2014	A very fun show to all ages. Really recommend. The kids will love it, for sure. The theatre is very nice, also.	11	4	Great Show	Luciano B
9	December 23, 2014	My wife and I bought Lion King tickets as an early Christmas present for our family. We went on Saturday to the 2pm showing. We had orchestra seats on the left side of the stage 4 rows back. The costumes are incredibly detailed and being close to the stage allowed us to truly enjoy the intricacies of the different costumes. The show is the same as the movie so I believe older children (and of course adults) will enjoy the humor. Although parts of the show will be entertaining to younger children, the length of the show will probably be a little much for younger children. There was a child about 5 or 6 yrs old close to us that started to get bored shortly after the intermission. The actors do a good job imitating the characters in the movie (especially their voices). The set and backgounds are nicely done as well. The seats in the orchestra are very roomy. You can even put your feet under the seat in front of you (similar to a seat in an economy plus seat in an airplane as far as room but much more comfortable). During intermission, I went up to the mezzanine and tried the seats there. Although they seem a little smaller, they did not seem as small as at the New Amsterdam Theater. The theater maintained a very comfortable temperature throughout the show (I was wearing an undershirt, button down shirt and a light sweater and jeans). Overall the show was very entertaining, the costumes are amazing, and the seats were comfortable. I would definitely recommend this show.	6	5	The Lion King is amazing!!!	jhmcateer
114	December 29, 2014	We managed to get tickets to see The Lion King on the Saturday night and it was simply amazing from start to finish ! We were advised to queue at the TKTS stand at Times Square for discounted tickets but due to wanting to see this particular show we headed straight to the Theatre to chance our luck. We managed to get tickets for $99 each and they were excellent ! The gentleman at the booth advised of a few options first of all but they were a tad expensive until he mentioned the $99 ones which were just 4 seats on their own to the side of the main rows ( a bit like where you would see the reserved boxes in the UK ) It really did feel like we had won a watch getting these tickets for such a good price. The drink inside the theatre is quite expensive but you are in Broadway watching a show of a lifetime and you get to keep the Lion King cups that they are served in :-) All in all a brilliant evening of entertainment and a must to go and see....	78	5	Simply brilliant, best show I have ever seen !!!	Paul0407
298	January 4, 2015	"My husband took me to see this show as a Christmas gift, as seeing a Broadway show was on my Bucket List. I was not disappointed. They have a bar where you can get Lion King-themed drinks (I got a Hakuna Matata), and of course a gift shop. The theatre has a great view of Times Square from the lobbies.  The show itself was impressive. The first act is almost exactly like the Disney movie, but the second act contains a few extra songs. The acting, singing, and dancing was great, and I especially liked the chorus/dance numbers. The kids playing Young Simba and Nala were adorable and talented.  The only thing I did not like was the costumes. The lions were okay, but the rest of them were too ""puppety"" to the point where it was distracting, especially Zazu and Timon. The actors did a great job, but it was hard to get past the puppets and suspension of disbelief. In general, though, it was an awesome show."	82	5	Great Christmas Gift	Lisa W
32	January 1, 2015	One word to describe the experience. Amazing! Brilliant night and money very well spent. One piece of advice is to book as early as possible as this show gets filled up very quickly (no surprises there). There aren't many words to describe the show itself as it really needs to be experienced to fully appreciate it. But whether you are going as a family (small children not recommended simply because you don't want them talking and ruining it for everyone else), couples or with friends it is ideal for all.  If you are going to NY, you have to see a Broadway show and The Lion king is a great place to start!	23	5	Quite simply amazing!	Navin M
67	January 6, 2015	It was a bit boring for the elders that have seen the movie and know the entire movie, but my sone and neice cannot stop talking about it. The kids in the play were absolutly shocking. They were amazingly perfect. The props and the way the show begins is breath taking! 	13	5	Best Kids Show on Broadway	heather w
62	January 10, 2015	You have got to see it!!! Completely amazing, from the venue to the puppetry, and the entire performance was the highlight of our trip. Some of the actors voices sounded just like the movie. The singing was incredible. We saw this on the last night and it completely topped our list of favorite things in NYC.	16	5	Amazing!!	TravelingWeWillGo
19	January 11, 2015	I had no interest in seeing this production, I took my mom for her birthday after years of hearing her talk about her desire to see the show. Four words: BEST BROADWAY PRODUCTION EVER! Definitely splurge and purchase a floor aisle seat you won't regret it. Hakuna matata 	60	5	Mother daughter trip	Kirsten F
39	January 8, 2015	It was an amazing experience! There was so much going on - you could clearly tell the actors were enjoying themselves as much as the audience! The outfits were truly mesmerising! Highly recommend seeing this show!	14	5	Amazing!	Kaley W
50	January 13, 2015	awesome! the music, but most of all the outfits. Love the show. Try to get an aisle seat, the dancers come down the aisle @ the start of th show.....My kids loved it!	22	5	Try to get a seat by the aisle	Sam W
72	January 17, 2015	The show and pageantry are outstanding, and worth the price of admission. It's all Disney - very well done, fantastically funny and action packed. The musical numbers... well, the performers are great, but the large amount of spoken dialogue, and the ...familiarity, maybe?... of the songs and the story make for less impact than many other shows. Ideal for kids, a one-time experience for most adults, or, at least, for me. It's not a question of quality, but simply target audience and presentation. The theater is comfortable, the cast gloriously talented and the costumes all alone a must see. The Minskoff has unmatched views of Times Square from the lobby.	22	4	Outstanding Entertainment, with pretty good music.	HokkaidoG
47	January 21, 2015	From the moment the music starts, you will be captivated by the energy transmitting from the stage and in the aisles .....It's electrifying, from the costumes, the voices, the dancing, the movements, the animals to.....THE ELEPHANT! I loved watching the two drummers (up above) on each side of the stage as they made magic on their instruments! Our seats were pricey, in the mezzanine section, hard to see faces and yet we heard everything. Wish we could have been closer, but this show sells out fast!	14	5	Heare Me Roar!	Kelly P
11	February 7, 2015	Just fabulous! Beautiful theatre overlooking Times Square. The thrill of the production coming out, through and over the audience was spectacular. Amazing costumes and capture the emotion wonderfully. Funny too! A lifelong memory for our family.	1	5	Must See!	mllca5
76	February 9, 2015	You don't want to miss this amazing show. The dancing, and beautiful cast mesmerize you. The music is great and the talented cast left me wanting more! This is not just a show for kids! Go see it now...	28	5	Breath Taking	TraciGaynorfun
4	February 15, 2015	Shocked that this has 19 poor reviews! But ignore them and listen to the 5500 excellent reviews.  Costumes really were amazing. Captivating. The acting was good, the songs were great. If your a lion king fan then it's very highly recommended. I was so excited to see this and it lived up to my expectations! Amazing show. Seats were set out well so i had a great view in orchestra. Fantastic show. 	2	5	Magical!!! 	A TripAdvisor Member
45	February 18, 2015	Amazing show. Costly, but worth the splurge. Scenery and costumes are out of this world- great for all ages. Probably my personal favorite broadway show.	27	5	Definitely worth it	DreLane
61	February 18, 2015	I've seen the show twice and was impressed both times (as were my kids/grandkids). The opening is unbelievable, as the large animals parade down the aisles. The music is non-stop and all very enjoyable (thank you Elton). The stage moves in every direction, the dancing is uplifting, and the costumes are fantastic. Most plays I have been to have their slow moments -- not this one. Go see it - no matter what your age!	24	5	Disney at its best	Paul D
34	January 23, 2015	Only my second broadway show and I was not disappointed to say the least. Had front row seats which was awesome. Show followed movie. 2.5 hours long with an intermission. Music was great. Acting was great. Go see this show 	23	5	5 stars... a must see	blakegrice
20	January 26, 2015	Absolutely loved it! Great for any age. Costumes were amazing. Actors were terrific. My favorite Broadway show ever!	4	5	I would go again!	terrimonroe7
64	January 29, 2015	Waited a long time to see this. Some plays (well, all really!) must be seen in NYC and this is one of them. The first song brought tears to my eyes with its beauty, the set and the costumes. This was just everything I dreamed it would be and then so much more. Beautiful, dream-like and whimsical. The costumes and sets are pure works of art. A memory that will stay in my heart.	27	5	Pure magic. Outstanding storytelling, set & costume design	Schweetheart
83	February 2, 2015	Music and costumes are superb. The show was magnificent. If I have another chance to be in New York, definitely I go again. Performance by the actors is just Great! 	74	5	Magnificent 	Kevin N
2	January 18, 2015	My wife and I were scammed by some people and bought fake tickets we went to Thursday show and the crew took amazing care of us.. They offered us discounted tickets with amazing seats and also gave us some sovenighers of the show. What a first class act and the show was amazing it made our vacation worth itafter a badexperience by some people who took advantage of us . Thankyou so much the show was amazing and we will recommend it to our friends.. James	88	5	Lion King	James W
167	January 19, 2015	This is such an excellent show. The way that they portray the story and all of the animals is awesome. The actors were superb. I didn't really want to go to this show because I thought it was more for kids but I thoroughly enjoyed it.	84	5	Great show	West_coast_Mac
32	January 20, 2015	The costumes were fantastic. Even though you already know the plot this show delivered a great Broadway experience for our family. Our seats were in row x in the orchestra section and they were perfect. Great view of the stage. Glad we didn't spend more to get closer.	12	4	Great show!	GL12342015
32	January 20, 2015	No need to insert course language (f***d up) to impress or intertain people. I brought young children to the show and didn't need that kind of spice	20	2	Overly innovative	familymanRiyadh
87	January 13, 2015	I really liked the musical. Bright show, wonderful costumes, singing, dancing, joking. All great. Can be viewed from any location, all perfectly clear.	35	5	super	Albina Y
60	January 14, 2015	Brilliant watch and by far the best show I've seen. Every actor was great and the costumes and props were amazing. Couldn't recommend it highly enough.	25	5	Amazing	Matt T
39	January 14, 2015	"What a fabulous show!! Love the story of Lion King but loved the Broadway rendition even more! The added songs fit perfectly and I laughed at the added dialogue! One line mentioned ""let it go"" from Frozen and the audience couldn't help but laugh! I loved that they kept it fresh. The music, the talented cast, extraordinary set and costumes ... you really can't miss this fabulous show while in NYC! "	24	5	Fabulous Show!! 	Brittany S
12	January 15, 2015	What a show, great performers, fabulous costumes and props, just amazing all round highly recommend the show to all ages, just fantastic.	7	5	Fantastic	Helen3Nigel
70	January 9, 2015	We took our adults daughters to see the Lion King, it was a wonderful, impressive performance! We were amazed at the talent with not only singing and dancing but done in some creative costumes! Facility was nice.	23	5	Enjoyable!	Arianna F
103	January 9, 2015	Colour, and spectacular scenery from start to end. A magical story that everyone will enjoy. We took two children aged 9 and 12 and both loved it.	60	5	A vibrant spectacular that all must witness	12madijack
12	January 9, 2015	I loved the music and the story. It was so entertaining. My grandchildren were mesmerized. It is good for both the young and the old.	3	5	great show	Starr K
12	January 10, 2015	I still can not get over the goosebumps I have experienced withing the first few seconds of the show. The cast are all amazingly talented. No matter what seat you have, it will still take your breath away. I did have a special meet and greet, which I suggest everyone get. The cast were all friendly and I was able to try on the Hyena apparatus. I will continue to go as much as possible. Worth the money!!	8	5	THE MOST AMAZING SHOW!!	Angel B
327	January 12, 2015	My wife has been talking about seeing the Lion King on Broadway, she saw it previously with our daughter several years ago while this was my first time seeing it. I managed to snag some excellent seats - 3rd row(!) on a cold winter's night - it was worth braving the cold! The show was everything you could expect in a Broadway show, great sets, singing, costumes and effects while leaving enough to the imagination to create a sense of wonder! I would recommend this to both adults and kids older than 6 or 7 - it's not really a show for toddlers or babies unlike the movie. Highly recommended! My favorite moment were updates to the script that included quotes from a current popular attraction that fit right into the context of the show - really well done!	125	5	Still Crazy (good) after all these years	Nomad0921
178	January 12, 2015	everything was great, from the very moment we entered the theatre....the exceeded my expectations..! (I may say I cried a lot)	43	5	just great..!	shopgirl28ar
102	January 13, 2015	"I took my 19 year daughter to her first Broadway show and it was amazing. The music and scenery is fantastic. Watching my daughter's face see the ""puppets"" was really fun. The stuffed animals were a bit overpriced if your bringing smaller children and they want a souvenir but, it was nice to see they were different from the usual Disney."	38	5	Amazing	J W
2	January 13, 2015	Breathtaking Broadway show!! Never experienced anything like it !! It was riveting to say the least .I hope in the near future we see it again!	54	5	Best Show EVER!!!	Skalalau
45	January 10, 2015	One of the most dramatic shows we saw. In just a few minutes you forget these are people playing the part of an animal. Colorful and great scenery with super acting and expressions. Am paying for Grandsons to go see it when they go to New York later this year. 	8	5	Greatest show seen	Margaret A
56	January 10, 2015	I took my 10 year old daughter to see this show and she absolutely loved it. The show was visually stunning, the music was great, and the theater was clean. We purchased our tickets 5 minutes before the show began and were lucky enough to get orchestra seats. We had a great time.	12	4	A Great Show	Opera W
58	January 11, 2015	So, we went to the Sunday Matinee of this show and just felt that there was a little lack of energy on the stage.  It was difficult not to compare it to a UK show as that is all we have seen before, and we were perhaps slightly disappointed.  it is a good show, but maybe we just picked the wrong time to go.	88	3	OK. But not like a UK Show	gavvyd
3	January 11, 2015	This was an unforgettable experience, we had second row seats which put us right into the performance, all the animals were very realistic and the actors were amazing! The child actors who played simba and nala were so cute and impressive! I highly recommend! 	4	5	Amazing experience!	Emma M
233	January 6, 2015	As a Disney production, the Lion King on Broadway is child friendly. The kids, especially if they know the movie and the songs, will be captivated by the show, and this serves as a great introduction to take the younger ones to a Broadway show. Of course the location in the heart of Times Square leaves you plenty to see and do before and after the show.	122	5	Kid Friendly Broadway Musical	ALRHA
57	January 6, 2015	I've seen many, many plays on and off Broadway. This production certainly lived up to all the rave reviews. The costumes were delightful and the way they depicted the antelope and the birds showed off the gracefulness of both species. We didn't tell my two grandchildren that the actors entered the stage by coming down the aisles. Imagine their surprise when they saw the rhino coming toward them! We were delighted when one of the opening solos was performed right by our row of seats! Just had a fantastic time - it was well worth the money.	16	5	What Fun!	k9judgeSC
105	January 6, 2015	This is an excellent show for all ages. Kids have lots of fun and adults get very emotional with the songs and story. It's always sold out, therefore it should be booked in advance.	39	5	excellent for all ages	RoThiebaut
99	January 7, 2015	Saw this show on Broadway at Christmas- great theatre - great staging and effects the cast were brilliant-If you get a chance go see it it's not just for kids	59	5	Magical performance	meacey
40	January 1, 2015	Awesome show. Get orchestra seats for best views. We were in Row L and we had excellent up close views of entire show.	32	5	Lion king	Konakolina
23	January 2, 2015	Amazing production and just like the west end production Timon & Pumba steal the show. You can see why this is a hot ticket, always sold out quickly and high prices but it's well worth the money. Well done to everyone involved from the stage to the backstage crew and the music crew in the wings 	11	5	Must see!!!!!!	LilWelshWonder
149	January 2, 2015	This was mine and my other halfs first Broadway show and couldn't recommend it enough. We enjoyed it all the way through. The cast run up and down the aisles, giving you a great theatre experience. I would suggest booking well in advance as tickets sell out very fast. Enjoy if you choose to see this. You won't be disappointed 	56	5	AMAZING	Karl G
110	January 3, 2015	But not my last. It was good clean entertainment for my whole family. I think anyone would enjoy this creative and energetic performance!	37	5	first broadway show	korinne n
57	January 5, 2015	My 14 year old daughter and I were worried that the production would be too geared to kids, but we were pleasantly surprised to the contrary. The inventive costumes and staging were really spectacular and the music and story were well played. I paid more for tickets on appx the 10th row center, and was glad I did. You could really see the detail of the production and costumes - which unlike a more typical production like Chicago were is full force here. 	23	5	Incredible costuming	Mike O
12	January 5, 2015	This musical was the best of Broadway thus far for me. The performances were excellent. The colorful costumes, the special effects just kept me mesmerized throughout the performances. All should see The Lion King at least once if not twice.	3	5	Mesmerized!!!!	979Rosiej
98	January 5, 2015	"Me and hubby went for this show on a Monday afternoon right before New Year. We only had one afternoon free and that's the only show available.. we were a little skeptical to what a ""kid"" show but we were wrong. The Lion King is truly a great show for all ages. The performance, stage design, production were all top notch. Highly recommend to anyone. Tips for seating, go online to check out the seating map before you buy the tickets. The theater is very big so it worth to pay extra to get a better seat!"	51	5	A great show for all ages.	silvia20003544
176	January 6, 2015	A wonderful production, great costumes, magnificent dance, singing, story, actors. A must-see for families.	70	5	Just wonderful	shelleydark
2	December 29, 2014	Only comment other than a thoroughly entertaining show was the Fact that theTheatre was very warm. Seems to be an issue in New York, where you go from very cold to very hot.regardless Show, Theatre, Facilities etc were all of a very high standard. Centrally located and bang in the middle of Times Square.	2	4	2nd time seeing it	Norsey001
95	December 30, 2014	The positive is that this is a stunning stage production with absolutely beautiful costumes, creative sets and colorful animals. The theater is unusually well designed to handle the crowd (and I hear it is mostly sold out). The dancers and actors are spectacular, mostly.  The problem with this musical is that it is exactly the same as the movie, and if you were wanting something original, this is not the musical to see. And, if you really don't like musicals in the first place, you will find yourself ready to leave at the intermission. You know how it ends... you've heard all music...and you have seen all the great costumes everyone has raved about.	61	4	Beautiful	katsat
16	December 31, 2014	If you ever want to see a play for the entire family to enjoy, kids to grandparents this is the play. I love every second of it. Bravo Our seats were in the first row which I do not recommend it was either that or the last row in the back. The theater is small so I would say all seats are good except the first 2 rows. Enjoy the greatest play ever.	7	5	The best play ever	Walkie_Miami
60	December 31, 2014	"I had a Boadway show on my bucket list....I asked my sister ( she had already seen the King 2 years before) and she said, "" I would see it again."" So we did!"	16	5	1st Broadway Show	YaYaAlice
39	December 25, 2014	Had a hard time following the dialogue. However, we were near the very top row of the theater. It was hot and restless with young folks. That said, the costumes and sets were very, very creative.	19	2	disappointed	stephen s
5	December 27, 2014	A must be in seat before show starts, or you have missed the show. I cannot put in words the excitement of the show. Very colorful and a lot of OMG moments. This was my third time seeing show.	1	5	"First 10 Seconds ""Mesmerizing"""	carolannc826
76	December 27, 2014	Absolutely Incredible. I had always wanted to see this show and what better place to see it than Broadway. Amazing. 10/10. incredible experience that I will never forget.	26	5	Incredible	JoelZoe1
362	December 28, 2014	This show was so good it brought tears to my eyes! Loved every second of it. It's a must watch! If it's ever in your city, don't miss the chance to watch this. The cast did great!	81	5	Amazing show	Vegasbum45
45	December 20, 2014	I have seen this show three times now and every time I see something new. The staging, the dancing, the singing, the performers, it is fantastic from start to finish. Also interesting going to a modern theatre on Broadway, quite different to going to the old quaint theatres in town	29	5	Timeless	matautraveller
17	December 21, 2014	This was one of the best musicals I have ever seen! The staging and storyline was fantastic! Brilliantly acted out and a wonder to see! I definitely plan on seeing it again! The strong African prescene, the music everything was simply captivating! Its great for the whole family or even solo. My only complaint was the occasional rock themed song, I didn't think it went too well with the overall ambiance of the show but otherwise it was still absolutely fantastic!	16	5	One of the best Musical I've seen!	Clayé G
179	December 22, 2014	This was my highlight of my recent NYC trip. We had read all the reviews and were of the opinion that it should be an amazing show. Nothing can prepare you for how amazing this performance is. Absolutely - you have to do this show is you visit NYC. The costumes, puppeteering and soundtracks are brilliant. If you going to take in 1 show whilst in NYC - do this one!	86	5	AWESOME!!	saramarsdenille
27	December 23, 2014	We enjoyed the Lion King, the music was great and performers were very entertaining. I think for the money I was expecting a little more but an experience we will never forget. 	13	5	Wonderful show	peaches0626

88	December 18, 2014	I think The Lion King would be brilliant in any city in the world. But there was something magical about seeing it on Broadway.  The theatre is great, you get a great view and experience from wherever you're sitting. The food and drinks are crazy expensive but that's to be expected at any Broadway show.  The singing and music is fantastic and the animals are quite mesmerising. The young boy that played the role of Simba was excellent!  Even if you've already experienced this stage production somewhere in the world, I would recommend seeing it on Broadway - it's a fantastic way to spend a night in NYC. 	51	5	A great show - extra special on Broadway	MellyL89
179	December 19, 2014	"one of the best musicals we've seen, but we always take the ""cheap seats"" that are usually $30-$50 - the ""cheap seats"" for the Lion King are $150 - go Disney!"	141	4	one of the best, but really really expensive	trevor-wa
220	December 15, 2014	the play is heart catching and a must do. i bought the ticket through expedia and i paid 150$ and by chance the offered me a vip ticket which made my experience more amazing. 1000 like. it was recommended by a friend and now i am recommending it to my friends. :)	70	5	amazing experience	nouhad1324

26	December 11, 2014	Follows the movie but it is more geared towards adults, although still kid friendly. (i.e., it's not a cartoon) If you ever want to see a Broadway play, this is the one to see. Amazing in every way, from customs, to singing, to acting, to overall general production.	5	5	A great Broadway play... like the movie, but better	l33ted
99	December 11, 2014	First rate production. Special effects were mind blowing. Everything very positive.Would recommend this for anyone going to New York City.	38	5	Two granddaughters loved it	MonteZuma50
25	December 12, 2014	Very good acting all round. I have seen lots of West End shows in London, so thought going to one on Broadway must be done! Only downside was the cost of $120 each(£90), compared with London £55-65.	13	5	Great show, little pricy!	teresa l
11	December 13, 2014	It has been 10 years or more since I saw it last, but my nephew and I were blown away by the costumes and performance. 	9	5	Still great	Bup_7

30	December 9, 2014	The creativity involved in creating this play is mindboggling. I first saw this in previews many many years ago. 	17	5	Pure entertainment for all ages	Adivechic914
6	December 9, 2014	We were disappointed in the Lion King Show. The musical ability of several cast members were average at best and sometimes were poor. In my opinion, not worth the money or time to go. 	3	2	Lion King - average show	Marie H
63	December 9, 2014	This was great the music the staging the Costumes most of all were just amazing. it really left me in awe.	29	5	Wow	LMT3
16	February 18, 2015	"I wasn't thrilled with the puppets that are clearly visible, nor the music. This play would be on my list of don't bother...However, that is my ""opinion""."	5	1	Not my favorite	D0llfacee
40	March 3, 2015	A beautiful performance of a classic, inspirational story. A must-see for all New York visitors. You cannot visit NYC without seeing a Broadway show, and TLK is a hot pick. I suggest you try to get seats as close to the front as you can in order to avoid feeling 'distant' from the show.	31	5	Soul-stirring and inspirational	pjharb
39	March 16, 2015	We saw this show on March 11, 2015. My 22 year old daughter really wanted to see this so we splurged and bought tickets ahead of time. We were in the right Orchestra row 10 or so on the inside aisle. Beautiful theater and comfortable. Great seats! Definately use the restroom before you come. They have very few for a theater this size and the wait is horrible. Our favorite scene is the opening number when the animals come down the aisle's so don't miss it. We had chills it was so amazing! This is the most visually beautiful and creative show we have seen. I now know why it has been on broadway for as long as it has been. It is worth every penny! We LOVED Rafiki! She was amazing! You won't be disappointed with The Lion King.	33	5	Gave me chills - must see!	drogers267
26	March 24, 2015	We saw an excellent show last week. Worth every penny. At the end of the show they collected money for hiv patients and other humanitarian causes, which was very kind of them. Excellent show.	14	5	Excellent show and humanitarian factors	Sophyaugust
5	April 8, 2015	We're currently visiting New York and all those we spoke to said this was a must, and so we did and was worth every penny! The production and cast and performance was outstanding!	158	5	Fantastic experience!	james e
29	April 20, 2015	Wonderful show that has stood the test of time. Go to the stage door and wait to meet the cast after the show!	6	5	Perfect Night	Alysia R
12	April 30, 2015	Great show or kids. A bit pricey, but worthwhile experience. First time Broadway show with kids and it was fun. Nice theater. Decent parking nearby.	39	4	Lion King	ckcVermont
14	May 10, 2015	Having seen a number of shows recently in the west end, London, I wasn't really sure whether this would live up to the hype. All I can say now is wow. The costumes, the stage work and the music is all too class. Truly memorable 	13	5	Amazing show in every way!	superdave80
43	May 15, 2015	A must see for any age. The costumes and music are phenomenol  The colors,acting , singing and choreography are amazing.  Well worth the price	26	5	Hypnotizing and a moral learned	loladeflores
97	May 28, 2015	This is even better than the Lion King movie! The costumes and props as well as scenery are vividly colored and elaborate. The music and singing is great. My son loved this show and wanted to see it again but it is a bit pricey to go to see again and again. We went with my mom/his grandma and all 3 generations of our family loved this timeless show.	53	5	Fantastic live show for kids and adults!	UNpeacekeeper
284	June 9, 2015	Not to be missed if you are in town.. We hesitated a lot before we booked the tickets but this show is amazing!!  It takes you back to your childhood it is full of life with great voices!!  I loved it!! 	77	5	Wow wow wow!	Didier G
140	June 22, 2015	If you loved the film, you will love the musical! We have seen a few shows on Broadway and the Lion King was one we have tried to see before but never got reasonably priced tickets. This time we were early and got them. Had high expectations as a 80's kid the film was my favorite! We were not disappointed! The only small minus for us with no kids were all the kids; the atmosphere is a bit different and the show is family adjusted.	41	5	If you loved the film, you will love the musical!	catasplund
101	June 29, 2015	I was very lucky to go and see The Lion King on my birthday last year. It was spectacular. The costumes, the singing, the performances were all amazing. I had goosebumps from the start to the end. A must see for everyone!!	37	5	One of the best experiences of my life	Michael B
30	July 2, 2015	I went expecting a stage version of the Disney movie, but this show is so much better. The music is amazing live, and the animals are brought to life in clever, creative, and beautiful ways. The atmosphere is the theatre is enchanting.	7	5	Surpassed my expectations	Christy H
164	July 3, 2015	I had a dream to see a show on Broadway and my partner wanted to see Lion King. This would not of been my first choice but the show was well worth seeing. The costumes we're awesome and the singing was amazing. I thought the second half was better than the first but really enjoyed the show. A great time on Broadway.	48	4	Had to experience broadway	LEZMAN
106	July 19, 2015	Absolutely amazing! The most expensive thing we did in NYC but by far the best! Got the tickets from the theater itself as they had the best price for the show in 2 nights time. I've never seen the movie so didn't really know what to expect so I thought the story and how it was told was brilliant! The costumes, the acting, the stage props and design....unbelievable. Some of the actors/singers are in the audience/aisles at stages during the performance. Also some of the actors were quite young - they have a great career ahead of them. Even though we were seated up in balcony, it was still a very good view. I would highly recommend.	73	5	The Lion King Review	Gmt2013
271	July 20, 2015	we wanted to go and see the Lion King. But the tickets are very expensiv. + 170 US$ per Person. The afternoon Show is a Little bit cheaper, but still too expensiv for us.	72	3	very expensiv	Manuela v
60	July 8, 2015	This was a great musical! Loved the actors, the music and the stage design. Very well worth the long wait. I have always wanted to watch the Lion King but did not have a chance. Finally I have managed to watch this with my husband. 	22	4	Must See Musical	Lulu Z
56	July 8, 2015	This is a great show for all ages, highly entertaining. The performers (particularly the very young ones), we amazing. We took my 20 year old son, and we all enjoyed this show very much. I would highly recommend this show to anyone thinking of seeing a Broadway show while in the city.	49	5	Fantastic Show	BandCHalik
171	July 8, 2015	Disney changes the level of Broadway entertainment. Great music, great set and innovative puppets. Great for all ages! Enjoy! Only draw back is hard to get tickets!	37	5	Great Show	atcnj
12	July 8, 2015	"This is the best show on Broadway. Yes, A BOLD STATEMENT. I have been going to the theater since 1970, lived in Manhattan most of my life, and I am a true theater devotee, both of musicals and dramas/comedies. I know of what I speak!  Every element of THE LION KING is original, incredibly creative, and unique.. From the magnificent , spectacular opening of ""Circle of Life"" you think well, this is so wonderful, like where can we go from here? IT GETS BETTER and BETTER! Each musical number is so well presented, so well thought out and imaginative, each number stands on its own. Yet the complete story itself is so moving and telling, but add such a singular production,it is like nothing else on Broadway or London's West End. The sets, the costumes, the presentation, the lighting.....it all creates such an experience, you just can't miss it!! The weakest part of the show is the musical score, but I was never an Elton John fan so it's probably me ... i find the songs,with a few exceptions, rather bland. Again, it's totally subjective, this score has achieved such fame, so obviously they are doing something right! I was a total cynic and finally decided to see what all the fuss was about. A show doesn't run this long for no good reasons!! I was gobsmacked, blown away by the spectacle of it all. It's a family friendly show, perfect for adults, teens and children alike, it speaks to all demographics. Don't miss it, well worth the trouble and money you will most likely have to spend to get a ticket, a high demand show, I know. But try.....wonderful rewards await!"	6	5	A MUST SEE - THE LION KING	jotheodorou
161	July 9, 2015	This musical never disappoints. The costumes are amazing and the actors are so graceful. My 9 year old loved it. It's expensive, but worth every penny.	58	5	Majestic	Sumer88
25	July 21, 2015	"Took my seven year old son to see this musical on Broadway at the Minskoff, where it has been running since 2006. First time he went to a musical, and he promptly announced just a few minutes into the performance that it was the best show he'd ever seen. Although it was a matinee and some of the lead performers were taking a no doubt well earned rest, the show still soared - fantastic costumes and props, great music, lashings of humour as per the Disney Movie and the great addition of the song ""He Lives in You"". Overall, a top performance worthy of the standing ovation at the end."	10	5	Worth every dollar	Kangster P
36	July 22, 2015	This was a spectacular play. The cast was outstanding. I didn't see the movie when it came out so I didn't know the story line going into performance. I was almost in tears at certain spots in play, very emotional . I felt very spiritual if that makes any sense	22	5	Best Broadway play ever	mcater904
13	July 22, 2015	I traveled half way round the world to see this show, but it was ruined by selfish people using cell phones. Why on earth don't theater staff control this problem? Where were they? For the second half of the show, there were no staff controlling this problem. Furious. Never again will I visit Broadway.	5	1	Please ban all cell phones!	GerraniumHongKong
5	July 10, 2015	My first ever show and I wasn't disappointed at all. The show is brilliant and a must see for people of all ages. If your looking for a show to see and haven't been before a must watch for any beginner 	13	5	Excellent	Paul D
19	July 12, 2015	The sow was amazing, the costoms were like nothing I've ever seen before, Transported to Africa, this is a must see show	4	5	AMAZING	aubreey
150	July 13, 2015	I had seen the Lion King in Sydney, so I dragged my daughter to see it in New York. She is not a theater person but I thought she would like this as she loved the movie as a child. I did enjoy it but I would have to say the Sydney production was much better. I found the sound alot better in Sydney and the characters voices also seemed to be stronger in the Sydney production. I'm not sure if it was the theater or not as we didnt see any more shows while we were there to compare. The price was about $30 more in New York as well. But over all I still loved it. 	68	4	I love The Lion King	keenastraveller
60	July 14, 2015	We had seen The Lion King about 4 years ago while visiting NYC. But, it was so incredible, we decided to see it again! The show is amazing for all ages!	31	5	Our 2nd Time... Amazing!	DanaHouston
85	July 18, 2015	This Broadway show is a classic that you must see! I highly recommend you sit in aisle seat in the orchestra section for the animal parade- well worth the money. 	42	5	A Classic Must See	Desmond574
41	July 6, 2015	"You don't have to be a professional to appreciate the talent of this cast. From the fabulous vocals to the incredible scenery, this is magic before your eyes. The theatre is large, and there's not a bad seat in the house. You're constantly thinking, ""How did they do that?!"" throughout the musical. A pleasure from start to finish, this is by far one of the most brilliant musicals I have ever seen. Expensive, but worth it, especially if you have children. You will be hard pressed to see anything better in live entertainment."	10	5	A Must See when visiting NYC	Beth C
6	July 6, 2015	This was our first Broadway show and it didn't disappoint. The performers were awesome and the visual effects were great. 	42	4	First Broadway show	Marc P
9	July 7, 2015	If you only have the opertunity to go to one musical, it has to be this one. The greate minds who have designed the costumes cannot be praised enogh. Knowing the film and the music is not nessesary. But if you do and love them, you will not be dissapointed. I have never seen anything this grand.	4	5	Number one	Signe S
180	June 30, 2015	This is a wonderful, beautiful, heartfelt show which is a family favorite. The costumes and decor are strikingly beautiful and effective, and the message of the play is positive. The theater is vast, so if you can afford more expensive seats, get them! This is one great theater spectacle which you won't soon--or ever--forget.	94	5	Not to be missed (especially if you're a kid--even if just at heart)	garyrichmond
47	June 30, 2015	"My wife has been wanting to see this play for years. We just never have seemed to get it together as we live on St. Thomas, USVI and travel plans haven't quite fit..until our last visit. Through the assistance of a good friend, we got seats. OMG, did we ever get seats! 9th row center. The anticipation doesn't prepare you for the opening. I still get chills when I recall the start...no spoiler alert...I won't give away what takes place but suffice it to say, you won't forget it and you will be singing, The Circle of LIfe for days! What an outstanding performance. ""Animals"" like real and the singing and acting of the cast is incredible. My wife LOVED it and, I have to admit, had tears of sorrow and joy throughout. What a night...one we won't forget...especially as we bought a woman's T-shirt and a"	20	5	Better than you can imagine!	Michael w
106	June 30, 2015	This show delivers visually from the very beginning! We were in awe of the detail in the animals, the costumes and the characters themselves. All of the stars delivered amazing vocals in addition to flawless dialogue. Everything in the show was over the top and we loved it! We had a little boy sitting behind us no more than about 5 years old who kept giggling and that just added to our enjoyment. It is truly a family show that keeps children of ALL ages mesmorized!	46	5	Great For All Ages!	Race2Win
323	July 1, 2015	….although our 11 year old granddaughter really enjoyed the show; so did my wife and I and our son and his wife. Glad we went. The show is about – wait…. you have to see it for yourself. But it is very active, colorful, with great music and some comedy. Very entertaining. Some action off-stage which gets you moving in your seat, the performers were very good. You don’t have to be in NYC to see this show as there are touring groups performing around the country and around the world. Please visit, it is worth it.	165	5	Not just for kids…….	raudetra
284	June 24, 2015	The Lion King at The Minskoff on Broadway last weekend was my first-ever Broadway experience and I was very impressed. My wife and I have done theatre in London's West End, so we're not strangers to good theatre. The Lion King is amazing. We went to the matinee with out 13-year old granddaughter and she loved it too.	346	5	Mind-Blowingly Great!	Andrew H
27	June 26, 2015	We took our 14 yr old granddaughter to see Lion King. When booking, we were torn between Wicked and this show. Finally Disney won out and she had a wonderful experience.  Since we had seen the show previously, I knew to get close (bought 4th row) and select an isle seat for Allison. The look on her face was worth our efforts.	11	5	Wonderful production!	Pbuff2
117	June 27, 2015	The Show is Incredible. We loved it so much . It won our hearts with all the beautiful colors and costumes. It just flooded so smoothly from start to finish. We could watch it over and over.	27	5	Simply Spectacular	Nancy G
62	June 28, 2015	Pay the price because this show is incredible! It even gave my partner goosebumps and he doesn't like Disney or any musicals!!	37	5	Absolutely fantastic!	Vicki B
7	June 12, 2015	Where do I start.... This show was just amazing from stat to finish! we had paid almost 200 dollars each for the tickets as we got last minute at hotel concierge but discovered afterwards, we should have just booked them at the theatre, where we would have gotten for less. in saying that, it was worth it and the show that was put on and the staging and costumes were just mind blowing. really really enjoyed it.	5	5	AMAZING!!!	Bernieonabike
12	June 14, 2015	This was our 1st Broadway show. Paid around $150 per ticket. We have seen many Vegas shows and didn't know what to expect from a Broadway show. It was certainly different! We had 4 seats in Orchestra, Row P, right in the middle of the row. Excellent seats! Close enough to see the expressions on their faces. Great singing, acting, comical here and there. There is one complaint in the merchandise that they sell. My teen bought the Hakuna Matada t-shirt for $40 and after I washed it for the 1st time, the stitching around the letterings came undone in the wash so a lot of the letters are about to fall off the front of the shirt and the inside has all tattered off so all the material (sheer material??) stuck to other clothes in the wash . Luckily I still had the receipt and called the phone # on there and spoke with a nice young lady who apologized and said we may have gotten a bad quality shirt and said she would mail us a replacement, due to arrive in about 1 week. I hope the replacement won't have any problems because $40 is pretty costly for a t-shirt.	3	4	Great choice for 1st Broadway show	4KsLuv2Travel
144	June 15, 2015	I has never been to a theatre show before, let alone a Broadway show. I'm glad I chose this show to be my first. I got my ticket from the theatres box office for the same night. Price was USD$157 but the seat I got was forth row from the stage, right in the centre. Great seat, good view. Extremely colourful vibrant and entertaining show. I think what enhanced the experience was that it was Broadway, but still take nothing away from the show as it had everything you could want from a top class production.	120	5	Colourful and vibrant	Dan A
57	June 19, 2015	We bought our tickets in advance for a Saturday evening show. It was great and the costumes are amazing! The music...LOVED it! I have also seen Phantom of the Opera and loved it. My daughters who are 22 loved this production and they said it met all their expectations. There are a couple of seats that have obstructed views so look carefully at the seating map when purchasing tickets. The gifts are overpriced. 	12	4	Broadway with my daughters!	Tracy M
19	June 2, 2015	must do once in a lifetime. Great show. Great costumes. Great performances. Great stage and theater. Very pricey. We sat in the second last row in the orchestra center and the view was undisturbed. Tip for single viewers - try going to the theater just before a show starts - they usually give single seats away for $ 99.	11	5	stimulates all your senses !	Rushdah
49	June 3, 2015	I was intrigued by the clever costumes and sets. The movie took on a new dimension seeing this on stage. I would recommend this to anyone who loves musicals.	20	4	Applause for a great show	cel11
53	June 4, 2015	It was our first show we have ever been too on Broadway. Amazing costumes, acting, effects, music, singing, storyline. Really took me away on a journey and away from normality. 100% recommend for adults and kids. No hesitation in recommending at all	9	5	Amazing	Mark W
24	June 8, 2015	"This once wonderful show is now bedraggled and sad. The cast was weak and seemed to be just going through the motions. Disney is clearly milking every penny from the show and filling seats with families with kids way too young for a Broadway show. The first act was ruined by an obnoxious woman who talked non-stop to her 3 and 5-year old kids. When asked to stop she indignantly said, ""this show is for children!"" They can have it. You couldn't pay me to sit through this again. What a sad way for this show to end up. "	10	1	Don't do it!	hamboss68
46	May 17, 2015	"This was the most amazing show I've ever seen! The talent and production are out of this world! We took my sister-in-law as a graduation gift. She's always been a huge fan of The Lion King. We all loved the show so much that we bought TONS of souvenirs to remember the occasion. You will not be disappointed if you choose to see this show! I would also like to add that the staff here was incredible. My husband came down with a terrible case of food poisoning while we were in New York and couldn't make the show. The box office staff assisted us with selling our ticket to another patron at face value. This assistance was incredibly helpful to me as I didn't want to lose all the money we'd spent on the ticket and I just couldn't imagine trying to ""scalp"" the ticket myself! The employees working the souvenir and concession stands were also very pleasant and helpful. "	7	5	Amazing! 	Jeri Lee H
735	May 21, 2015	Booked well in advance, very popular show to see. I wasn't disappointed even though my seats were up the back you could still see and hear very well and that you were witnessing something special. The cast were enthusiastic in their performance and the scenery was reasonable and it did the job well. Merchandise available for sale though you got a booklet on the cast, etc.	190	4	Well worth it, performances outstanding.	Alice R
36	May 24, 2015	Having not been to many theatre shows, my Partner and I are no experts, but we found this one to be fantastic! We had seats in centre orchestra which I thought gave a brilliant view of the whole show. Aisle seats would give you views of the production when the cast walked past. I was crying one minute in which is not like me! Very good costumes, songs and enthusiastic performers considering they do the performance 8 days a week. Well worth the money and a must when you are staying in New York.	32	5	Superb!	joanne r
23	May 27, 2015	This show is simply amazing. Everything was great, the actors, their voices, the music, everything! We were truly impressed and I can say as one of the best things we did on our trip.	3	5	Simply Amazing	YoliCotto
147	May 10, 2015	When we came in the Theater it looked very small, the seats were small, decoration was not that nice, so we had a bad feeling.... but then.... Then the show starts, the song Circle of Live started and it was great, nice, amazing, excellent and beautiful !! We had very good seats and it was from the start till the end amazing ! You can buy drinks and you can take them in to the theater.	34	5	This is amazing !	Raffie C
128	May 11, 2015	The costumes were great and the music and story telling was excellent. It is a live version of the movie. Very well done. 	36	5	Awesome Costumes	Mark H
186	May 13, 2015	We went to lion king show with my parents in U.S...... The show was super spectacular and well worth the money spent ...live music was awesome and characters dressed up in their costumes ... It was a truly a visual treat to the eyes ...  Even my mom who could not understand full English enjoyed because of the costumes and music :)  I wish to see it again on my trip back this year for sure :) 	56	5	A spectacular show !!! One of a kind :) 	PranaliBmumbai
3	May 14, 2015	The Lion King is a must-see. We went with kids ages 5 and 7 and were all entertained. The music was wonderful and the costumes / scenery was also. The only bummer was the guy who answered his phone 4 times during the show :(	8	5	wonderful show!	853w
17	May 1, 2015	With amazing scenarios and performance, I was amused!! Great actors and singers, as well as the great plot that is Lion King! For me Scar was the best! Amazing performance! Certainly you'll get impressed visually by the contrast of colors, dances and costumes! It might be a little expensive, but totally pay off!	8	5	An incredible experience	Werner M
176	May 3, 2015	Our kindergarten and prekindergarten students attended this outstanding show as part of our studies of Kenya and it was a thrilling experience for all. It is a show you shouldn't miss! The costumes are inspiring and the sets are so artistic. Every performer was outstanding. Our students were mezmorized and so were the adult chaperones. If you can purchase group tickets, the price is reasonable for the quality of this performance. You won't be disappointed!	83	5	School trip A+	prekteacher1214
36	May 7, 2015	My daughter chose and scheduled the Lion King prior to our coming to NYC on a girls' vacation. Another daughter and a granddaughter completed our party of four. The show was beyond amazing! The first act with the many animals and cast on stage was one of the most thrilling things we have ever seen. The whole production with its dancing puppets, music, and costuming was both stunning and memorable. What a wonderful experience!	14	5	Stunning and Memorable!	Carol T
42	May 9, 2015	Open I had lil tear .... was lovely how they tried to draw you in to it. The voices of the stars were fab and I just loved the entire performance. 	7	5	Amazing ....best performance 	heavenholiday
160	April 21, 2015	This was our first Broadway show, however we recently saw KA in Vegas, and I had to stop myself from comparing as they are totally different productions. Got goosebumps when they sang circle of life, but the standout performers were Musafa, old Nula and old Simba. Their voices were amazing! Cast was very energetic. A good performance.	100	4	Great singing by some of the cast	DBH_15
55	April 23, 2015	The show was 2 hours with a 15 min break. It was spectacular!! Worth the money. The way the actors used their body in the animal costumes were amazing. I actually got misty eyed when the show first started. Just moving and beautiful. I love seeing the woman dressed in tradition African dress, just beautiful.	41	5	Must go!	donna m
87	April 26, 2015	It is just different enough from the cartoon to stay interesting. The actors were excellent. We were told that the traveling show that tours the country does not have all the props; so broadway is the way to go. The bad news is the tickets are expensive and are never offered at the tkts discount booth.	58	5	Great show, very cool how the actors turned into animals	GregCCMD
47	April 29, 2015	Being my first trip to NYC I had to experience Broadway. If you manage to book ahead of time you will find good seats for great prices. The show: absolutely memorable. Colors, Characters, Songs, Hakuna mattata..... the whole experience is once in a lifetime so do not miss it. The actors have amazing voices, the costumes and colors are spot on and some of the animals are just outstandingly formed. What's more halfway through the performance you have birds dancing around you in the audience. You'll feel like a child again. Also kudos on the show collecting money to send to the people who need it the most in Africa. Make sure you get yourself a tshirt or a memorabilia !	11	5	Don't miss it !	Salpy D
34	April 8, 2015	Words cannot describe the costumes and staging of this Broadway musical. Music was beautiful as well, but was just mesmerized by the creativity of the production. 	12	5	Amazing staging!	Lisa T
2	April 10, 2015	I grew up on Disney and my friend and I decided to play tourist and come in and see a show and goof around for a day. We both love Disney - so we had been saving up for Lion King. The one downside is the cost - but visually it is amazing! Great acting and singing. The puppets were excellent - I love how they were able to make the performer part of the package. This was a couple of days ago and I'm still blown away. Really worth the money!	2	5	A visual treat!	Marie C
61	April 13, 2015	After 17 years on Broadway, in my opinion, The Lion King is still one of the best shows on Broadway. This was the third time my husband and I had seen it, the second time my 13-year-old son had seen it, and the first time for my 6-year-old daughter. The show is just as amazing the second and third time you see as it is the first. The sets and costumes are absolutely amazing and the cast is top notch. It is currently playing at the Minskoff Theater which is right across the street from the Marriott Marquis where we were staying in the heart of Times Square. For a $350 donation to designated charities, we were given a full backstage tour by the director. The kids loved seeing the costumes and set items up close as well as how they store everything when it's not on stage. I highly recommend the back stage tour! My kids voted going toThe Lion King as the best thing we did in New York City this trip.	49	5	Just can't beat The Lion King!	kroller64
92	April 17, 2015	I still don't know how Disney imagined this show..... It brought tears to my eyes. The music is, of course, amazing, moving, funny, uplifting, etc. Loved it!	57	5	Fantastic!!!	MariaMedranda
42	March 25, 2015	"Tickets to this show were what I gave my fiance for Christmas. She was VERY pleased. The show lived up to the hype and was AMAZING! We got tickets on the front row of the balcony and it was a great choice. During ""Circle of Life"" a performer sang right in front of us. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"	16	5	Fiance's Christmas Gift - Check!

39	March 28, 2015	If you are in NYC and are going to a Broadway show, The Lion King is a must see. We sat on the 4th row from the stage, and it was a little too close because I felt like we were having to look up to see it. I think a couple rows back would have been better.	9	5	Fabulous!	JuejueRN
41	April 1, 2015	OMG this was such a great production. I see why it has remained on Broadway all of these years. The cast were fairly new to Broadway and I couldn't tell. I love that they collected donations at the end of the show to support Africa. 	6	5	LOVE this show!	Sheana H

1	March 18, 2015	show was excellent, the lighting perfect. The costumes beautiful. The  orchestra on key. The closing sales pitch and asking for donations by having  people stand and ask for anything even change a total disappointment. Having  paid $609 for tickets $100 for souvenir and $39 on snacks. I'm sure those  profits could go towards the charity of your choice rather than make me feel  obligated to show that I care by giving more. The way it was handled was not  what I would expect from The Lion King production. I considered the production  a high quality and high class show but unfortunately the whole show was  overshadowed by the request for change or donations. I felt like I was at church  when they bring out the basket for the second offering.	2	3	Disappointed by request for donations after the show	Businesslink22
191	March 20, 2015	Interesting puppetry and sets although quite pricey. Great vocals and costumes as well. Second half was much better than the first.	76	4	Good show	zaz04
74	March 22, 2015	Absolutely loved this show. Very talented actors with amazing voices. I'm so glad I went. I'd suggest getting the better seats as you definitely noticed how far away you were at the back :(	26	5	Amazing show	Sarah R
124	March 4, 2015	My family and I got the opportunity to see Lion King while we were visiting our daughter. for Thanksgiving. It was well worth every penny. I really did not know what to expect although I had a recommendation from our high school Drama teacher who takes kids to NY almost every year. We were captivated to say the least. The costumes, music, acting, set design were wonderful. We had really good seats about half way back close to the aisle. You need to arrive about 30 minutes early. They were kind enough to help me park my electric mobility. The tickets were cheaper to buy at the ticket booth than on line so my daughter purchased them a couple of months ahead of time. We ate at Bubba Shrimps Restaurant afterwards since it stays open late and is close to the theater.	30	5	You Must See Lion King in NY	Melody J
77	March 12, 2015	This is a show that keeps you engrossed from the get go and keeps you glued to the seats till the end. Kids would love this, but alone, as a couple or with parents or friends, this is for for all. Things to watch: + Amazing music captures the moment. + Stage setting is incredible. + Brilliantly choreographed dance sequences. + Funny and immensely enjoyable. It is a bit expensive, but well worth the visit. I've been putting it off for some time and when I finally watched it, I do not have any misgivings. Money well spent.  Whether you are a visitor or a stay here, this should go to the top of your must do list.  Tip: The theatre is not not that big, so the downside for a cheaper seat is not that much. Back centre will do as good plus save you a bit. I was in the Orchestra upfront, but I think even at back seats, this will be worthwhile.	50	5	Must see	Arun Kumar T
84	March 14, 2015	We finally made the splurge for the tickets and we were not disappointed. The singing was beautiful. The stage was bright and costumes were creatively designed. It was interesting to see how they were able to make people look like animals. The theatre was comfortable. I would say more comfortable than most broadway theaters. The seat were soft and a little more leg room. The theatre had organized getting into your seats well. I would recommend this show.  My only complaint is people are able to eat snacks during the show and they sell them in the theatre. However, the woman was eating Pringles when the show restarted and it was distracting. The workers are really on top of cell phone users because its extremely distracting. The women next to me brought hers out almost every ten mins for the first half of the show until I asked her to put it away. I know it is not the theatre/shows fault but it took away from the show.	37	5	Excellant Show	Amber Jean R
14	March 15, 2015	I just want to go back and watch it again because I was thrilled about the costumes and cast.The best part is the people that come see their amazed faces on them.  By the way, I am 8 years old. 	4	5	#amaz 	gilnvic

It brings so many childhood memories, be prepared for goosebumps and a little bit of tears. After watching it for the first time I'm ready to watch it again!"	21	5	Breathtaking	Jose S
52	July 30, 2015	"Disney continues to deliver on this play. We were back and took our three children. Everyone, parents included were very pleased. The actors all appeared very much ""into"" the performance. The price is steep even for NYC but dig down on this one and make it part of your stay."	44	5	Well worth it	bigappletraveller
27	August 14, 2015	I was not sure if I should spend almost 100$ on a show.. It's really great. You will remember that for a long time. I still remember my feelings from the moment when left this teatre and listened all those tracks on spotify and walking through NYC... :)	6	5	Must see	adamkow
22	August 19, 2015	Love the show. Amazing. Better than I imagined. I recommend booking a seat on the floor to get the full experience of the show. I've also seen this in the UK and the UK one is boring compared to this one. 	27	5	Brilliant 	Becky K
1	August 22, 2015	"In a trip to New York City that offered unbearably hot weather, painful stomach aches and boring trips to the Museum, one of the few highlights was getting the chance to see ""The Lion King"" Broadway Musical. When I first heard that they were making a musical out of the classic animated film from the 1990's, I was rather taken aback. However, surprisingly, it turned out to be a dream come true. Elaborately staged, beautifully acted and bringing back the popular songs we've come to love, ""The Lion King"" blew me away. No amount of words or adjectives can do justice to how good this musical truly is. Each actor, each song and each scene is perfectly brought back to life and celebrates the legacy of the film. Even more impressive, the show starts with a bang and ends with a bang. Despite the exhausting running time of 2 and half hours, you're never bored. In a nutshell, if you're a fan of the movie don't miss out on this wonderful play. I don't even watch many Broadway musicals, but this one reminded me of the nostalgic time when I first watched ""The Lion King"" as a young child. To put it into simplest terms, if you loved the movie, you'll love this musical. Chances are that you'll be humming the tunes as you make your way out of the theater. It's the opportunity of a lifetime, so don't make the mistake of missing out in it."	42	5	A Dream Come True	Hassan I
35	August 24, 2015	For my dads 83rd birthday party,he took us all(19 of us) to see The Lion King. Always wanted to go. We were thrilled. Atmosphere in theatre was unique. Costumes,performance,music were unbelievable.One of the best shows I ever saw !	8	5	Birthday party	marc z
25	August 25, 2015	We absolutely loved this show. Within 5 minutes of the show starting I was practically in tears - it was just so amazing. The actor who play Rafiki was absolutely outstanding and we think of her often (even though we have been to see it in London's West end since) - she is something special!	34	5	Absolutely magnificent!

25	September 5, 2015	Bestest show I have ever seen and the whole family thoroughly enjoyed every moment. Specially entertaining for younger kids. Ample parking is available in parking garages around. We booked parking spot online, it turned out fine. 	4	5	Amazing! 	Ahmad K
2	September 24, 2015	"Talk about opening a show with a bang! ""Circle of Life"" gave me life. This was the best live show I have ever seen! I went home and watched the movie for the 10th time after seeing this show. The production was amazing. The choreography was fantastic. And the singing vocals blended together seamlessly. I highly recommend this show to everyone. I would definitely see this again."	123	5	The Lion King is king of Broadway	iheartnewyork2015

39	October 17, 2015	We watched the show at the beginning of October - amazing show! Definitely a MUST SEE show in New York. Everything in this show is so fabulous - the set and decorations, the costumes of the  actors, the music - absolutely wonderful! Some tips about the seats at Minskoff theatre: 1. The theatre is not so big (as we thought after looking at some pictures over the web) - you can see good enough from any seat. 2. Our seats were: Orchestra section, Row L, seats 2 and 4 (on the aisle). Those seats are on the right wing of the theatre, therefore they are less expensive than the seats on the center. The view was great, close to the stage, very recommended. Watch the animals crossing next to you during the show :) For conclusion: The LION KING show - very recommended!!	15	5	!!Amazing show, the best in Manhattan	Elad05092015
288	October 29, 2015	This is an amazing production. Characters are all over - in the balcony, in the aisles. The sound is very good and the seating comfortable. Be sure to see it. Worth the money.	48	5	Wow	BobtheBuilder39
70	November 4, 2015	"We thoroughly enjoyed the Lion King. From the costumes, the songs, the acting, the ambiance it was magnificent! This is a play for all family members. We saw seniors to kids in the audience. I now it was ""only"" a play but it was very moving and engaging."	26	5	The Lion King Roars	Lee R
613	November 11, 2015	This was my second time seeing The Lion King, and it never disappoints. The innovative nature of the costuming, puppetry, and sets is positively astounding. I am even impressed with how they are constantly making tiny tweaks to certain scenes and adapting jokes to be more contemporary. Every time you see, something will be new. If you can, I would recommend getting seats close to the aisle as often the characters walk right by you, and it is incredible to be able to see the intricacy of the costuming up close. However, no matter where you sit, even if in the balcony, the show really does a phenomenal job of drawing you in to the point where everyone feels included. This is certainly on the top of my list of things to do and see for tourists - or even locals - in NYC!	175	5	Truly the King of all Broadway shows	waverider681
26	November 18, 2015	This show has been playing for 18 years and as many times as we have been to New York, we had never seen it. We needed something to occupy 1 extra night in the city, so I purchased tickets for hubby and myself.... No children. My husband thought I had made a bad choice when he saw all the children in the theatre, but once it began..... He, we were mesmerized!!!!  I knew beforehand about the characters entrance into the theatre, but didn't tell my husband and enjoyed the look on his face as he watched the animals all come prancing beside him by his aisle seat!!! It was wonderful and Ai can see why after 28 years, it is still intriguing audiences.	11	5	Spectacular!!!	wlsteen
7	November 21, 2015	Have to admit I bought Premium tickets. Worth every penny. You do want to take the free cushion. I brought a book to read to him before curtain & during intermission.

13	November 25, 2015	"Seeing The Lion King in Broadway was one of the things we did on our recent trip to New York. As someone who is not the world's most avid theatre goer and someone who on the whole despises Disney, I didn’t have huge expectations. Even then, I was still a little disappointed and left the theatre distinctly averagely impressed by this show. It was still good and entertaining, but the production seemed small to me and didn’t justify the fairly high ticket prices. The best things about the show are the blending of the visual aspects – the set, the costumes and the puppetry. In the opening number, director Julie Taymor has created one of the most transporting visions I’ve seen in a show - a procession of African beasts – including flocks of birds, leaping gazelles, elephants and towering giraffes (consisting of two actors on stilts - really impressive) - moves through the aisles, all interpreted via stunning, minutely detailed costumes and puppetry. The elegant puppet-like figures that are in the shape of the animals controlled by the actors on stage were amazingly creative, especially those of Timon and the hyenas. However, I thought that the show let itself down a couple of times by being a little too clever – on occasion the audience was left wondering what specific costumes were representing and, especially in the opening scene, there was too much going on at the same time for us to take it all in. In contrast, there were also sections where very little happens and the performance came very close to dragging. The story is not great – it’s based on a reactionary Disney cartoon about the natural right of kings in which the circle of life is pitted against an evil uncle and his jive-talking ghetto hyena pals. But the humour of the show and the tone in general, does help alleviate this and there are enough innuendos together with plenty of in-jokes and self-referencing to keep adults entertained. This is particularly the case in the second half, with the introduction of Timon and Pumbaa. In fact, I think that this switch to a more character-driven storyline rather than an action-driven approach enables the second half to move along more satisfactorily than the first, where the story’s lack of punch meant that the show was struggling to keep its momentum at times. The score is also not great. There are some memorable songs like 'Circle of Life' and ""He Lives in You"" but most of Elton John’s and Tim Rice’s over-sentimental songs about staying cool and seeing your ancestors in the stars are quite ordinary and instantly forgettable. The movie’s original score is expanded with African rhythm and music, which adds colour to the show. Some of the acting and singing was pretty average. There were simply no impressive voices (apart from the older Nala) and some were even difficult to hear over the orchestra. I’ve read elsewhere that that may have been the result a poor sound system at the theatre. The dancing was lack lustre and clumsy. I did think the child actors who played the young Simba and Nala were adorable and talented individuals. They were the most entertaining part. There were many people in the Minskoff Theatre who loved the performance but for me it was disappointing and not up to standard. It may be an iconic show, and it is visually impressive, but Broadway has better shows overall, and I should have gone to see one of those rather than Lion King. Furthermore, the merchandise was ridiculously over-priced. As for the theatre, the seating has reasonable leg room, the staff are helpful and attentive, and, in the central lobby area, there are massive windows with a great view on to Times Square."	66	3	Went in with low expectations which weren't met	blackadders62
95	November 27, 2015	This show was really great and the children in audience was great they were well behaved story was great kids laughing, I loved it all and would see it see it again. Highly recommended for all ages.	31	5	Fabulous	Sandi-Jo L
24	November 11, 2015	Piped in tracks abound, and when the actors are actually singing, the orchestra drowned out the voices. Whoever was doing sound on this show was asleep on the job. The actors looked like they were phoning it in. This show is strictly for tourists who simply want to tell people back home that they saw TLK on Broadway -- they don't care if it is good or bad. And it is bad...really, really BAD. Don't waste your money!	30	1	The worst	Babola123
1	November 13, 2015	0 stars disgustingly rude cast collecting donations at the end of the play as I watched a couple get denied a photo taken together bc they only donated once when the donation was supposed to include the entire group I was rudely yelled at by a cast member that it was not my place to complain about the disgusting behavior I witnessed !!! Do not donate to the cause because only a percentage of proceeds go to the organizations and not even the cast members who knew everything did not know what percentage it was !!! I am so disgusted with them and their behaviors I have already told multiple people not to waste their money on this show and I can not wait to file my official complaint for a refund for how disgustingly rude they were after my cost of ticket pays their salaries !!! I would not recommend this to anyone!!!	3	1	TERRIBLE STAFF RUDE CAST AFTER PAYING FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE DISGUSTING MANAGER!	Olivia B

33	November 16, 2015	I booked this show from Australia. No problem with receiving e-tickets and it was easy to locate my pre booked seats.	13	4	Loved this show	Jenny D
44	November 6, 2015	I went to this show solo because my husband didn't feel comfortable leaving our baby with a sitter in the hotel. Also, I have a sneaky suspicion that he wanted to watch some game anyways. Either way, I was happy to go to the show with or without him! It was such a fun show. I was 10 years old when the original movie came out in theaters and it was actually the first movie I ever saw in theaters. I grew up on the classic 90s Disney movies so I was so excited to see this show. I was sitting I the middle on the main level about halfway to the back and had a great view of everything. I sat next to some kids and they seemed to be enjoying it but I found myself with a HUGE smile on my face and I think I may have enjoyed it more haha. The music and costumes and dancing - all incredible. Definitely not to be missed!	19	5	Amazing Show!	kelikea

10	November 9, 2015	My very first Broadway show did not disappoint.  So thrilled I was able to see this show!  Costumes and set design were on point.  All the actors did very well! We were in the last row on the bottom and could see everything!	8	5	AMAZING	M R
91	November 10, 2015	I've heard a lot about the Lion King so I finally decided to go see it. I took my younger brother with me for the 630pm Sunday show. The theater is very nice, there's a large selection of alcoholic beverages for the adults, and the show was absolutely amazing. The costumes were beautiful, detailed and creative. There were moments where different actors playing animals came from the audience side onto the stage which helped with engaging the audience. The show also incorporated a few funny lines relating to the new Disney song for Frozen so that was a nice modern touch. I highly recommend seeing this if you're in NYC! 	27	5	Amazing show! 	Lily C
60	October 30, 2015	We left it until the day before to get tickets and it was a weekend so we were 2nd row from the back at the top but was definately still good. easy to get into, lots of funny moments and never boring.

15	November 2, 2015	I had a vision of going to broadway (i live in new Zealand) to see the Lion King on the night of my 50th Birthday. that came true last month and it did not disappoint. the who New York/ Broadway experience was phenomenal, but the seeing the Lion king was the icing on the birthday cake (excuse the pun) i loved every minute. it is a long standing show for broadway but I found it to be a polished show with the cast giving it their all. word of warning, don't think that the disney movie which is suitable for youngsters and in fact all ages translates onto stage. i don't believe its a show for younger people, although my 13 year old daughter/companion to the show really enjoyed it.  definitely made my 50th birthday the memorable occasion that i wanted it to be	5	5	one of the best shows I've seen	Carolnkatie
9	November 3, 2015	A fantastic experience- saw it in Los Angeles a LONG time ago, but the music is timeless, and seeing it live is a must-do for anyone who likes musicals, live performances, or the original Disney movie. Tickets are expensive (very few, if any, discounts like most other shows), but the experience is absolutely worth it if you have the means.	2	5	Fantastic Show	Jessica G
11	November 4, 2015	My partner bought me these tickets for my birthday for whilst we were in New York and the show was excellent. It was colourful and energetic and the singing voices of those on stage were better than I expected. Only downside for us was the poor sound system, I have near perfect hearing, as does my partner and at several stages we struggled to make out the words/singing being said/sung. The theatre is clean and quite impressive with its massive windows looking out on to Times Square but could really do with vast improvements to its audio equipment. Bare in mind, this is a Disney musical and the audience is full of kids so expect the odd slight disruption.	4	4	Excellent Theatrics - Poor Sound System	Jamie696
12	October 18, 2015	We were a party of 3 adults and 2, 8 year olds and were fortunate to get aisle seats. The Lion King characters walked to the stage and passed right by my grand son.. The show and the experience were just wonderful! Perfect for this age group and for the adults too. I was actually surprised that this show was packed with adults. I thought there would be many more children there. 	20	5	Awesome experience at the Lion King	Norine W
168	October 19, 2015	I know I am a member of a tiny minority who found this show an ordeal to sit through. I appreciated the masks and the skill that went into the choreography and singing but I could not shake the feeling that I was watching a soul-less Disney production.

154	October 14, 2015	Words cannot describe the excitement and enjoyment from this entire experience. This was a birthday present for my daughter and from buying the tickets when we arrived in NYC to after the show kept us on a high. These performers are exceptional and are so engaged with each other and the audience! We had front row side seats but really there is not a bad seat in the theater. After the show we took pictures in the lobby and visited the gift areas which a tip would be to get your souvenirs before the show. It was terribly crowded afterwards but employees did really good getting people waited on in a timely manner. The colors and details of the costumes and props were indescribable. I could go again tomorrow and be just as excited. After the show some of the actors came out the side door in the breezeway of the theater and signed our playbills and took pictures. They were very gracious and humble when we told them how good they were and how much we enjoyed their performance. I truly see why it's such a long running production. It is definitely a must see when in NYC!!	93	5	FABULOUS!!!	Bankerchic77

63	October 16, 2015	If you have kids, you've probably seen the animated version more that once, and were afraid it would be a redundant version. Wrong! This is a great interpretation of that classic. The costumes are the best I've ever seen bar none. Well choreographed and cast. Huge animals -elephants, rhino's, giraffes all operated physically by humans. A lot of different age groups in the audience and I never heard a single kid cry- they were as amazed as I was.	25	5	Broadway's definition of Amazing	mmethart

112	October 12, 2015	My family of four went to see the Lion King on Broadway. I had seen Wicked before but this was my family's first trip to NYC. We sat in the EE seats and thought they were great. The music was a little weird and it took a little while to get used to characters in masks instead of the Disney cartoon we grew up with. Overall, we really enjoyed the show and would definitely recommend it for families with kids. 	52	5	Great for families 	allygator78

Even if you don't think you like musicals, this is must see show regardless of your age. The costumes, the choreography, the set design well there's just so much to take in...in absolute wonder. Truly Disney magic at work.	39	5	Magical - A must see show & then see it again!	Reggae052011
5	October 5, 2015	This is a wonderful show that won't disappoint! From the costumes and props to the music you are sure to be entertained and delighted. My 9 year old niece and my 67 year old mother both found it to be an amazing experience for viewers of all ages!	1	5	See The Lion King!!	Traci T
323	October 7, 2015	2nd time at this show, 1st time was with my husband, this time we brought the kids. The costumes are amazing. A definite must see. The casts puts their heart and soul into the performance, which includes a few children who play the young Nala and Simba. Theater was roomy with plenty of legroom and arm room. We sat in the Mezzanine, stage left in one of the little rows toward the front, great seats.	111	5	Timeless Classic on Broadway	vickieDOTcom
104	September 25, 2015	If you have kids don't hesitate to see this show. If you don't have kids don't hesitate to see this magnificent, first rate show. The Minskoff theater also offers one of the best views of times Square once you are in the main lobby. Fantastic from start to finish.	29	5	Fantastic for all audiences	Riley R
150	September 29, 2015	It's definitely a must see. Not for very young children, can be scary and it's very long. The first rows of the mezzanine have the best seats. If you sit in the orchestra, you'll miss seeing the whole stage.	53	5	A must see hit	Ashley28806
28	September 30, 2015	What an incredible show! My girlfriend suggested booking tickets for The Lion King last minute before we flew to the US. They were quite expensive, but it's something she had always wanted to do - and how often do we find ourselves in NYC! It turned out to be the best show I've ever seen. The cast was brilliant, the puppets are very cleverly done, and the music takes you back to your childhood. We both had a tear in our eye overcome with emotion during the 'Circle of Life' rendition. The venue is also great, you get a good view from pretty much anywhere I'd imagine. Prices are high, as you'd expect - but you can save your money for a late dinner or drinks after the show! Cannot recommend this experience highly enough. Attended the 7pm show 26th August 2015.	6	5	FANTASTIC - Must see!	Jack O
34	October 1, 2015	During our visit from abroad, my husband, our couple friends and I watched the lion king as our first Broadway show ever! What a beautiful musical! The acting is wonderful, the costumes, the music is incredible!  I even teared during certain scenes!  The musical is exactly as the lion king Disney movie, which made it a little too predictable (and the men with us got a little bored), but that didn't stop me from enjoying every moment of it! Definitely a Must see!	18	5	Amazing show that took me back to my childhood!	yasmine b
87	September 14, 2015	A life time show! It is a good investment to see this magical musical, the view from the mezzanine is good as you can see the entire stage however i guess from lower level should be pretty good as those seats are more expensive. You dont need to spend more money unless you want drinks and souvenirs, if not there are spots to drink water.	25	5	Wow	Alain V
56	September 16, 2015	The best show I have seen. Its something we will never forget. The production is amazing with swift changes & brilliant cast. The costumes are fantastic & it really feels like its the first show, I cant believe they do this twice a day as its just faultless.	31	5	Incredible!!	Braddersam
15	September 8, 2015	I have seen it in Hamburg and New York. It's just awesome. The actors are great, the story a little sad but made with funny scenes. I was almost crying 'cause I Love it.	8	5	Fantastic!	58AnnH2013
55	September 23, 2015	This was my first broadway play and I was so happy to see it as my first one, it is a great theater, great staging and very professional play, if you go to NYC, please try as much as you can to see this play because it is very exciting!	16	4	Emotional and exciting	Alfredo S
67	September 18, 2015	Wife had been wanting to see the lion king and took her to see it. I was not thrilled to be going as I did not like phantom of the Opera and left before it was over. Even as the show started I did not want to be there but I have to say it was a great show it was,really a great performance and changed my mind on plays. And made my wife happy wich makes everyone happy. 	16	5	Not what I expected. 	moosky12
93	September 10, 2015	I believe its the longest running show and still pulls crowds pricey still u need to stand in lines for it and a must see if u have the buget and the time	19	5	Still running	Naveed A
24	September 16, 2015	If your in NYC, you must visit the theatre, highly recommend The Lion King! What an absolutely amazing show, from the stage, actors and singing, this is a must see! 	20	5	Amazing show	Jason D
3485	September 10, 2015	This famous show is one of the gòod ones here.Worth the evening spent watching and enjoying. You must see.	648	5	See	SE s
35	September 11, 2015	I have seen the show in multiple cities but there is something about seeing in NYC that makes it so much better. I vote this number one show to see in NYC. It another must to do on the to do list. 	28	5	Best show	John H
199	September 13, 2015	Amazing but expensive. Theatre not massive so even from the back row seats you get a good view. Production and costumes are stunning.	39	5	Stunning	Jen F
82	September 1, 2015	A good musical with decent acting and great songs. The scenery, costumes and stage tricks were excellent.	101	4	Very watchable	ricor29
300	September 2, 2015	This was absolutely amazing and so beautiful, such a talented group of people... I am glad we chose The Lion King for our Broadway night :) Hakuna Matata!	94	5	Just excellent!	evyboo
34	September 2, 2015	Great Songs you leave the theater with a smile on your face. Perfect for the whole family. Truly unique costumes	6	5	Lion King	proendoeast60
4	September 3, 2015	I wasn't sure what to expect being a giant Disney fan - but from the word go, you travel into a magical world of dance, and song. The amazing costumes, stage and acting keep you engaged the entire time. An absolutely amazing time! It really is a magical theater experience.	6	5	An Encaptivating Adventure	Syud A
169	August 27, 2015	I went to see The Lion King with my BF and his son age 9 and daughter age 12. It plays at the Minskoff Theatre which is elevated above Times Square. This makes for a really nice photo opportunity once you have gone up the first set of elevators as they have plate glass windows from floor to ceiling looking out on 7th avenue/broadway. They also have freestanding costumed (not live people but mannequins) characters that you can pose and take pictures with.  We sat in the mezzanine second row which I thought was perfect. I have found that the smaller kids have a hard time seeing the stage from the orchestra. Being higher up for this kind of show also let's you experience the magic of the costuming. I don't want to be so close that I can tell it is a man in an elephant costume. I want to look out and see what looks like an elephant on the stage. The costumes are incredible. Trust me.  They have booster seats available which we used for his son despite being high up, so if your child is short and stuck behind a row of tall heads, grab a booster cushion to give them some lift. They are usually sitting outside the doors to the theater. If you arrive late for the show, they won't let you in until the first musical number is over so try to get there on time. This is one of those shows that continues to sell out without the need to offer discounts so good luck finding one. I usually use Broadway Box but have never found discounts for this show, ever.  I think the best chance would be to wait for Broadway week when they have the 2 for 1 specials and go online immediately as even these tickets are gone incredibly fast.  The show is great for young kids.	81	5	Costumes incredible	jenandcody
79	August 30, 2015	Choose only this Broadway show for our USA trip and am very happy we make the right choice. The cast, sets, music, ambience are all perfect. Audience are very encouraging to applaud after every act. Some pleasant surprises when actors come from the back and through the aisles. 	25	5	Captivating from start to end!	JorinGoh
37	August 19, 2015	There's a reason why the tickets are expensive - it's because it's all worth it! The Lion King is an amazing broadway musical with outstanding performances, amazing voices, and unbelievable props and costumes. I don't normally buy shirts but I just had to get a Lion King shirt. I immediately bought the soundtrack online when I got home. A must see for kids and adults alike.	11	5	Miss all broadway musicals EXCEPT The Lion King	Francis Joseph S
14	August 20, 2015	This was my Gran's pick for our Broadway show on our trip and have to say I agreed with it! The costumes were fantastic, the vocals were extraordinary and the cast were fantastic. The young stars were the highlight of the show and they stole the thunder for the adult cast. It was brilliant. A really good night out and I would highly recommend it.	2	4	Brilliant Show on Broadway	11erobb
24	August 20, 2015	exellent show .expensive tickets but well worth the money.definatly recommend .would go and see this show again .music and theatre production were excellent.	11	5	excellent theatre production	zetec
30	August 21, 2015	Had a very great time and enjoyed every second of the show. Highly recommend to see it. Actors did a great job	9	5	Great family experience	Bencedez2
300	August 15, 2015	"I would think anyone with a 7 year old daughter should come see this as an intro to Broadway. Although I wouldn't rate it as the best production I've ever seen, it was nicely done overall. It delighted my 7 year old daughter and I would think that it's a neat intro to Broadway for familes with 6-10 year olds I took ""premium seating"" on the right hand side, rows 2 & 3. About $750 for the 3 of us...and I honestly can't say that I would take the seats again. They're just too close to the stage and don't offer a great view/angle/elevation. It was nice being on the aisle and having all the cast walk past but I somewhat wih we had gone with the closer (higher priced) Mez seats on the left or right wing. A couple of the actors actually took the time to sign autographs when leaving the theatre.  So....Overall...Sure I'd go again..It was a pretty neat family experience and watching my daughter's eyes light up was worth it alone...but I'll also keep in mind that marketing's definition of ""premium"" is perhaps skewed in favor of profits and that a better overall experience could be had with some of the non-premium seating."	250	4	"Neat show. We enjoyed it. closer ""premium seats"" not worth the extra$$$"	theswissmister
35	August 16, 2015	Just so wonderfully unique with the puppet-like additions to the costumes, the headdresses, etc. All the music you love from the movie is there, and sing very well. Just can't express how lovely this production is.	8	5	Wonderful!	KyBriTyMom
13	August 17, 2015	The Lion King is an amazing experience. The tickets are pricey but well worth it. The costumes and props are incredible. It's a must-see.	7	5	Amazing Production	Julie A
85	August 17, 2015	We were lucky to see Alton Fitzgerald White's last presentation! He was really good as the lion king! We took some time to decide which shows to take a 13 yo and a 4yo in order for both of them to enjoy, but we were very fortunate to have chosen the Lion King! My 4 yo son loved cheered and danced and got sad at times! He loved the show and so did us all. The animals coming from just beside us were a great surprise! Costumes are amazing and the music is impressive! We loved it all!	40	5	Good for all ages!	Christiane F
235	August 4, 2015	The Lion King in all its glory. Fun to be had by all. The costumes are great. The song are catchy and the performance is worth every cent. Go with family. A must family attraction. 	69	4	Fun for all the Family	Loren778899
134	August 6, 2015	Awesome! The play was so well put together from the actors to the costumes to the production itself. We loved it and highly recommend The Lion King to anyone going to New York! 	29	5	The Lion King was the King of Plays in NY	Jerry R
31	August 8, 2015	Show was truly breathtaking, unforgettable experience! Spectacular effects and costumes.  If you are in for a bargain and you don't really care where you will be seated try to buy tickets on spot just before the show or use TKTS ticket booth in Tmes Square. But there might be no tickets because it is so popular! If you are planning ahead, book online, theatre is quite small and you have good view from everywhere. It is worth every penny, highly recommended!!!	10	5	Best musical/show ever!!!	Jana H
66	August 12, 2015	My fiancee and I took our 5-year-old granddaughter to the performance, not sure if she was ready or if she would be afraid. It turned out to be more than a memory, but a life experience that none of us will ever forget! We were enthralled start to finish, and is still becomes the topic of many conversations! I hope the show is running 4 years from now, so that we can take our 1-year-old!	26	5	A Life Experience Forever	Teresa B
28	August 13, 2015	First time at broadway and our first show. Show is amazing. Sat front row in the mezzanine and had a great view of the performance, but missed parts of the animal parade that happens at the beginning of the show.	53	4	Awesome show	Shinda S
249	July 31, 2015	I seen this show in Las Vegas at Mandalay, it was one of the best shows I have seen. The costumes were amazing, I took my 3 yr old grandson and he loved it but couldn't stay awake because of the time change.	57	5	Seen in Las Vegas	debikc4
7	August 1, 2015	My husband took me to New York for an anniversary present to see the Lion King and we were totally blown away. From the music to the actors absolutely breathtaking. We were taken by the beauty and the entire experience and this will be one of the best memories of our lives. You have to see this show - hands down!!	1	5	Absolutely unbelievable!!! I Loved it!	TerPit
103	August 3, 2015	Seeing a Broadway play in NYC was #1 on my bucket list! I was not disappointed . It was AMAZING! We seen Lion King it was breath taking!!! When the show began my friends & I literally had happy tears in our eyes it was so amazing! The theater is beautiful, clean & the staff was extremely helpful & kind!	30	5	Dream come True	FunyWVgal
159	December 1, 2015	In one word amazing! I saw the show a couple of years ago and forgot how good it was! The Teatre itself is not the most confortable but we had a great time.	94	5	Exvellent show	Sab0405
395	December 10, 2015	Went with friends who chose the show. Can't criticise the professionalism of the show at all but not my cup of tea. The costumes are outstanding and the cast are very good at what they do.	253	4	Very Good But Not For Me!	NorthExplorers
54	December 15, 2015	Amazing cast and music. Great dialogue and comedic timing. An enjoyable show for children and adults of all ages. Everyone loved this sassy Scar and Zazu. The improvised dialogues are the best. 	31	5	Awesome show. 	watercrown
8	December 15, 2015	Would love to go back again in the future. Definitely a must if coming to NYC for the day or even a weekend.	28	5	Great Show!	colleen c
151	December 16, 2015	This is one of those few attractions that adults, teenagers, and even young children enjoy. Check attack killer, fantastic, wonderful are all words that miss the mark and trying to describe this Broadway show.	38	5	Can't beat this energy and talent.	savebythesea
36	December 21, 2015	The talents and coordination of the performers is awing. The creativity of the costumes also leaves your jaw dropped. I saw in the Mezzanine row D seat 136 and enjoyed the show greatly. I feel that you should not stress spending large $$ to enjoy the show, spend what you feel is comfortable and you will not regret it.	3	5	Lion King at the Minskoff Theather, spectacular production	Qomomoko
21	December 26, 2015	Tickets are expensive but the show is spectacular! The second floor is a good option in case you won't spend a lot of money in tickets.  At some point, you forgot that are people on stage and you only see animals... That's crazy. This is the type of show that you could see over and over again.	12	5	Amazing!	Hbelman
34	January 2, 2016	Such a great interpretation of the film. By far the fest show on Broadway at the moment. Mezzanine level tickets are fine because the show if we'll spread on the stage and facial recognition is not a massive requirement of the show. Definitely recommend 	9	5	Best Show Ever	Jason O
52	January 9, 2016	This was a really nice show. The costumes were absolutely amazing. The singing was beautiful. My friend and I had a girl's night out. The actor's did a good job. In my opinion teenage Simba, though his voice was beautiful, was overacting. Everyone else was on point. I was most impressed by the costumes, the giraffes were my top favorite but they were all excellent, even the grass.	15	4	The costumes were amazing	Amanda0683
96	January 13, 2016	I had not seen the movie and still have not seen it... but I can tell you this show is phenomenal! The actors, music and stage décor make this show come alive! We sate in the orchestra section, row U. From here, we could see everything and it was quite a show. Don't miss this one!	13	5	EXCELLENT!!!	DaBombDiggy
31	January 16, 2016	We booked ahead of going to New York & thought we'd go for the stalls tickets. The show was very good - but we'd paid £120 each & afterwards thought that was far too much money for what we'd seen! For us it was no different to seeing it in London for 1/4 of the price. We used the official website so we weren't ripped off with a website selling tickets on - just very expensive. 	20	4	Great show but VERY expensive tickets!!!	LDR61019
2	January 22, 2016	This show was so well executed and the animals so realistic. The music of course was inspiring even the teenagers in our group had a great time, much to their surprise. One of the better ones! Go book it!	1	5	Roaring success	caro S
6	February 2, 2016	Thoroughly enjoyed the performance and performers. I would love to see it again. I recommend it for anyone including children.	2	5	Excellent Show	hkbaje
121	February 8, 2016	I saw the Lion King about four times. I always take my nieces and nephews. I am glad they change the costume from the opening show. It is fantastic and since My Dad was an Ambassador to Ghana, Nigeria,Liberia and Kenya.It was a beautiful reminder of my growing years/ I have two grand kids 3 &5 and could not wait to take them to the show again. Be sure to get orchestra ticket. Being in the highest floor of the theater is a challenge.	38	5	Best Experience on Broadway	jojonyc464
21	February 8, 2016	It is a wonderful show for all ages. Try and get an isle seat the beginning is amazing as they walk into the theater.	18	5	Wonderful show!	Dottydmb
2	February 21, 2016	This show surpassed my expectations !! My family & I have always been a huge fan of The Lion King ( #1 Disney movie all time favorite ) but to have seen it LIVE on Broadway was absolutely AMAZING !! If this is not on your To-Do-List / Bucket List make it a top priority ! So when you go NY to see The Statue of Liberty ☑️, Empire ☑️, 9/11 Museum ☑️, shopping in Time Square ☑️, etc., make sure to put THE LION KING ON BROADWAY ☑️ too !! You'll Be Thankful you did !! 	1	5	A Must see @ any age ! 	Nicole F
38	February 24, 2016	I loved every minute of it, from walking in the door to walking out the door, it was the best experience ever and was better than I expected!  The cast are amazing , the backstage team are amazing, the set was amazing, EVERYTHING was amazing! I didn't think they'd be able to pull some parts of the show off but they did!  My boyfriend who is a massive grump even smiled through it haha!  $14 for two tiny cups of juice but what do you expect, wasn't moaning! Everyone must see a Broadway show! We sat in the Mezz row A seats 110 and 111 and they were great! 	15	5	Must do!	Nicole S
41	February 12, 2016	I never rven considered going to a play or a broadway show in NY. But this time I was in MY with my 3 year old son, and there waThe Lion King and Aladin.  and being a still huge fan of Aladin I tried manipulating my kid to go see it but he was dead fixed on the lion king, so we went.. and boy am I glad we did!! it was amazing! mesmerizing! we were transfixed on the play the whole time!!  Not a fan of the lion king? yeah you should still go see it. it really is that good. 	48	5	My first broadway show 	Aseel B
14	February 20, 2016	This was my first time watching a Broadway show, and it was an exceptional experience. I loved every bit of it. Perfect for all ages. It was the perfect combination of music, dance and theater. It was worth every single penny! I will definitely go back to watch the show again, and look forward to taking my family as well. Must see at least once! 	7	5	Must See! 	SheyS05
33	February 24, 2016	I've never watched a Broadway show, so upon my first real trip of New York, I had a lot of choices. So I searched the tripadvisor top, and Lion King was at the top of the list. I thought it would be a little simple and childish for me since I know everything taht happens. And yes, the plot was directly from a children's movie, but what I didn't realize was how well everything was captured. It was amazing.  From the get go, I was fascinated by the costuming and design. The orchestra was amazing as well. Then the talent/ from the acting to the singing - wow! Each character had their moment, and I found myself having the tunes run around my head even a few days later. I never knew I would like it so much but it turned out to be my favorite thing out of my entire New York trip.  I got the pricy seats from ticketmaster for $425 total for 2 as I heard they never get discounted. Rows H seats 108/109 was just around the middle of the bottom level in the center, and it provided exceptional viewing. I think a few letters around this range would provide the best views. Also, the Minskoff Theatre is an excellent venue and the 2nd floor has a nice view of Times Square broadway street. Situated right between Junior's and Carmine's for some eats beforehand. For a first time Broadway experience, Lion King is a 100% recommendation to me.	25	5	First time broadway - Spellbound	linkwtm
34	February 28, 2016	If you're an avid fan of Disney's The Lion King film, then this Broadway production is a MUST-SEE! It brings to life the story and characters we grew up loving. The production design, the performance and most importantly, the music, is simply out of this world! If you find yourself in NYC, this is one activity that you simply cannot afford to miss out on... Please!	16	5	WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE IT!	Preshanthan
18	February 13, 2016	We visited NYC for my birthday, and we decided to see two shows, one of which was The Lion King. We enjoyed the show a immensely. The songs, acting, and plot were all fantastic, but the set and costumes were where it really shone -- it was unlike anything I had ever seen before. My only complaint is that The Lion King is a very popular, often touristy attraction, so the audience wasn't very polite -- talking during the scenes, etc. Overall, The Lion King was amazing; I would highly recommend it for families with young children.	5	4	Wonderful Production	William R
242	February 17, 2016	What more can I say, it's just a fantastic show, beautiful costumes, great songs, wonderful entertainment, my 2 sons aged 15 and 16 loved it too. 	100	5	Fantastic show	SueWestYorkshire_10
104	February 18, 2016	We decided that as we were going to New York we had to see a show on Broadway, we weren't disappointed with the Lion King. Tickets were more expensive with it being Broadway but the atmosphere and costumes were amazing. The cast kept you entertained for the full duration of the show and I would recommend everyone to see it.	41	5	Fantastic Show	17Merlin
19	February 19, 2016	Just pure family entertainment in a great theatre in a great location. Cast were magnificent. Thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend to all.	9	5	Fantastic!	Pjf10
7	February 9, 2016	Great experience. A great show for children to get an appreciation for the magic of Broadway. With the help of Disney - of course....	1	5	Great Show	ADang2
22	February 9, 2016	I went with my grandson. It was his first Broadway show. it is a very accommodating theater.It is so well done. I highly recommend it.	6	5	Fantastic Staging	Christina M
380	February 10, 2016	My husband booked and bought me this as part of my 40th bday gift. He was not as excited as I was to be seeing this show as have wanted to see it for a long time and where better to see it than Broadway. No cameras were allowed so I took a few pics before it started. From the moment it started until it finished I was in heaven. It was fantastic and I was so emotional that when it first started and the actors came down the aisles in there costumes, animal costumes i was moved to tears. I have always loved the Lion King film and this was the real thing and so much better on a higher scale. The costumes were out of this world and the actors who were on stilts for the animal costumes were amazing. the staging was brilliant and they sang all the songs and I sang along with them and I didn't stop smiling from start to finish.  Unfortunately hubby didn't think it was as good as I did but he's never been a fan of the Disney franchise unlike me. The actors put there hearts and souls into everything and the way the animal actors moved with there wings or woteva was just fantastic. I cant recommend going to see this highly enough and yes the tickets were very expensive but worth every penny in my opinion. If you lov the film you will be in heaven watching this.	162	5	Best way to celebrate my 40th bday	Suzibeaton
56	February 11, 2016	This play had us intrigued the whole time. We truly enjoyed the music, dancing, costumes, and sets throughout this Broadway play that been running for a long time. More than we expected, great time in NY. Loved by all kids 8 - 80	15	5	The family loved it...	Double D
2	February 8, 2016	This is a wonderful show for the entire family it has fun, thrills and drama. The sound effects are amazing the costumes are definitely a hit but the story is what i found delightful lest i forget the music simply fantastic. It's a must see you'll be amazed I would definitely recommend The Lion King	59	5	One of the Best Broadway Shows	lucian w
7	February 8, 2016	One of the best shows I've ever seen..Took grandchildren ( 10 & 8) and then saw it again with just my husband and loved just as much..Spectacular Broadway.	1	5	THE BEST !!!!!!	Palpattie
12	February 8, 2016	Simply spectacular! The plot, the music, Magnificent costumes. If you get an isle seat in the orchestra- you really feel the energy of the performers running through the isles. We loved it so much, we actually saw it twice	8	5	A must see Broadway show!	Petr S
24	February 8, 2016	Went last with my family and I must say it's the best Broadway show I have ever been. This is one Broadway show I would like to see again. The show is for all age groups and my family loves it.	18	5	Best Broadway show	jsami685
29	February 4, 2016	Finally managed to get the tickets last Saturday. I have been trying to watch this show for years. It does not matter how old you are. This show is a classic!!	7	5	Hakuna Matata	Anji29
19	February 4, 2016	Came to the show with a large group of teenagers. At first the boys of the group were pretty dissapointed we weren't going to a sporting event but by intermission they couldn't stop talking about how much they were enjoying it. It was actually one of their highlights when telling their parents about the trip. The show was great and way beyond expectations. The actors were wonderful and the costumes were top notch! 	5	5	AMAZING 	Lindsey W
4	February 8, 2016	Went to see the Lion King about 10 years ago when my now 17 year old was 7. It was a great show. It was fantastic and the performers gave it their all. I was blown away. I went to see it again last month with my youngest child who is 9 now and it was very disappointing. No passion. You could see people behind the curtain. Quality and passion behind the singing was lackluster. It honestly felt like they were just going thought the motions and milking the tourists that come to see it. Very disappointing.	2	2	Just going through the motions and milking its reputation	jabs28
5	February 8, 2016	Stunning show! Wonderful staging, beautiful sets and costumes. And the music is so memorable. Highly recommend!!	7	5	Amazing show!	drdavid526
10	January 23, 2016	It was a completely enjoyable show. The costumes were amazing and the voices of the characters were just as in the movie. The only downside was that the theater only had one set of bathrooms, which left a very long line at intermission.	2	5	A show for everyone!	Dinah H
391	January 28, 2016	If you want to get kids into theatre, this is a good choice. They've seen the movie and know the story. The costumes are AMAZING and the direction is interesting. Not a great show, but great for kids.	57	4	Good for Kids	KatKealy
207	January 28, 2016	Everyone mentioning kids! We had no kids and loved it! the production is outstanding with fantastic outfits and great soundtrack as always! One of the highlights of the trip and we ended up singing the lion king songs for the rest of the holiday!	91	5	Amazing for ADULTS!	Crystalarts
29	January 31, 2016	My friends and I went last night. I have wanted to see this show for at least 10 years and I finally saw it. The beginning score sent shivers up my spine. An absolute must see, the performance, the set, the music, a great time!	8	5	Broadway week deal	efitz24
26	January 16, 2016	As a non-enthusiast for plays....I must say I was on the edge of my seat the entire show. From a breathtaking intro to a phenomenal ending...this is true and through an amazing play. From the lead roles to the background characters, it was definitely a highlight of our Christmas visit to NYC.....thank you so much! Also a big acknowledgement to everyone from the greeters to the bar staff....you are all professionals in your field. Just one comment....ouch on the souvenir pricing. We might of got caught up in the moment, but the sticker shock woke us up fast.....lol	12	5	An Experience of a Lifetime - Just AMAZING	AllegroLounge
5	January 17, 2016	My teenage son complained that we were going to see the Lion King and after the show, he couldn't stop talking about it. It was a huge hit! 	27	5	Love 	Amanda L
13	January 20, 2016	Well worth a visit to see this! Staff were all so helpful and friendly, from door staff, ticket collectors and bar staff. Excellent experience and performance was 1st class!! 	7	5	Amazing 	Holidaymakers1
109	January 21, 2016	"I liked this show, but I walked away yearning for more, like the magic of Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc. I had gone there based on all the rave reviews, but I thought the show was somewhat overrated. Good show, not ""great""."	39	4	Good, but not my favorite Disney show	PlatinumEyes
51	January 14, 2016	The show does not deviate from the Lion King - which can be boring for parents. Excellent sets, costumes and music. 	34	4	good show - great for kids	work2travel54
2	January 14, 2016	This show was my favorite Broadway so far. The actors/dancers and costumes and sets were so amazing. They added some comedy in making it appealing to all ages. It was 2 hours 40 minutes with 15 intermission which seemed like a good length, not too long but long enough to get a good story line in. 	1	5	Well Worth the Money 	Jamie C
51	January 15, 2016	I had always wanted to see lion king in the theatre it was my favourite film growing up and when we can to New York I just had to see it! It was brilliant and I I can not fault the show in any way! It was brilliant as when the show starts the come through the crowd up onto the stage! I loved it and would go and see it again and again!! There were lots of variety in the audience, young families, couples and mature couples. You have to watch this! 	21	5	Love love love!	Sarah D
62	January 15, 2016	The Musical was just awesome. The cast is really good / talented and the costumes are on point. Best Musical that ive been to up to now. Worth its price.	13	5	Amazing!	Isabel_K90
112	January 10, 2016	Great show and music. It never fails in entertaining. Will be on Broadway as long as it wants to be there. Will go back next to see Aladdin. Also heard good things	39	5	Amazing. Never fails.	4service
21	January 10, 2016	Waited 18 years before finally buying tickets. We had row C center in the mezzanine. Seats were excellent & the show was a memorable experience, glad we went. 	4	5	Lion King left us speechless	Anthom515
46	January 11, 2016	Brilliant show, helpful staff everywhere and lovely merchandise to purchase. The show itself was amazing, eyes were glued to the stage the entire time! Worth the investment. 	29	5	Absolutely amazing show! 	CoralWoodcock
65	January 11, 2016	What a show, don't let the price stop you from going it's worth every penny and more. I would go see it again if I had the chance. 	34	5	Wow..	danjamesjones
13	January 3, 2016	We were sat next to the aisle for the show which was great as they came down the aisle at the start of the show. The costumes and songs and whole performance was amazing. I would definitely recommend to anyone. (If you bought a cocktail or something at the theatre for the show you also got to keep the Lion King mug that it came in)	10	5	Amazing!	Kate R
12	January 6, 2016	Tickets to this show were a Christmas gift for my child, and Lion King did not disappoint! Costumes, performances, songs were all fantastic! We sat in ORCH J 1-5 and the seats were great. Aisle was great because they come down the aisle a couple times. The theatre was smaller than we expected, so I'm sure almost any seat would be fine. I might avoid the far sides.	5	5	Amazing! Even better than expected!	22traveller2015
94	January 7, 2016	WOW! Everyone raves about this show and we finally took our boys to see it and we all loved it. The staging and costumes were incredible. The leads and music were excellent and Pumba and Timon were very funny as was the bird Zazu. The actors came down the aisle several times which was neat. Also, anything you purchase in the lobby you can bring into the show including drinks in Lion King souvenir cups.  The seats have plenty of legroom and you are not sitting on top of one another like in some other theaters. We had four single orchestra seats, as we purchased them last minute via the box office, which was very helpful. Our boys didn't mind not sitting immediately next to us and we avoided paying the over priced ticket brokers fees.	38	5	Terrific Show!	Suicu
357	January 8, 2016	Was able to bag some tickets on the 4th row to see this amazing show. We were not disappointed, it was absolutely incredible. The tickets were $165 each but worth every cent. We absolutely loved the production. The costumes are brilliant and the performance gave me chills. Was thinking to myself I don't know how they are going to act out certain scenes in the film like the Buffalo stampede and when mufasa dies but they did an amazing job! The theatre is very busy and you have to arrive 30 minutes prior to the show started. The queue went all the way into Times Square, but it didn't take long to filter through and find our seats. The theatre isn't massive so wherever you sit you will have a pretty decent view. You can tell why it is the no.1 musical. It is magical! 	103	5	Incredible 🦁🦁🦁	Sarah_Norwich85
68	December 27, 2015	We saw the the performance with our two daughters. Very good. Very professional. Decor, actors were amazing. Presenting the film on stage and the way it was done was superb	11	5	Lion roarrrr	ErikvanDriel
173	December 30, 2015	I don't know why I was not so impressed. I was impressed by the animals coming down though and the great acting skills of Rafiki. The other parts were pretty much just the same as the original lion king. I would recommend you watch this broadway with a kid and watch it near the stage where you can see the animals coming down the isles. 	113	4	My sister loved this place	LenaPera
8	December 30, 2015	This was BY FAR the most visual show. The cast is amazing. All ages enjoy it. Take a stroll around Manhattan before the show and then grab some desserts after. 	1	5	The Lion King	Jk9081
18	December 30, 2015	Great show - so glad to have finally seen this after wanting to for so many years. Excellent performances! So sad to have not brought our children on this trip as they would have loved the show.	19	5	Highly recommend!	AimeeEvans354
213	December 21, 2015	I've watched a number of shows, The Lion King Broadway show is by far the best I've ever seen. It's been the number one rated show on Broadway for a while. Tickets are a bit expensive, try checking when they are touring around the country, might find cheaper tickets somewhere close by! 	61	5	Best show I've ever seen 	OssamaGhazal
268	December 22, 2015	We have seen the Disney movie with our kids plenty of times, but the play is beyond amazing. All the actors bring all the characters to real life. The songs move you and you just don't want the show to end. Our tickets were expensive but after the show they felt worth it for us. We have seen at least 10 Broadway plays so far, but The Lion King remains our favorite. What can I write that hasn't been said already.	404	5	How can I convince you to go	Moe_Ipak
38	December 23, 2015	Hyped up by my daughter and my wife always wanting to see this show I bit the bullet while in New York to see how it's done. The opening scene was a grand occasion but it was spoilt by the theatres policy of allowing late-comers disturb the experience.  The puppetry was very cleaver but once this wonder wore off you are left with nonsense talking, nonsense singing and a children's storyline. There must be many small minded people to glorify this for it to become so successful when its place definitely belongs in a Disney Children's Video. 	21	2	Once you get over the puppetry it's quite boring.	AppR0SS
80	December 25, 2015	This was a bucket list item for us and the lion king did not disappoint. The set was breathtaking and the customs were very creative. We forgot that there were humans in the parts of many of the different animal characters. Great music and story. 	25	5	Wonderful show	kaaina
17	December 16, 2015	You must see this show! Great for the young and young at heart! Great to always check out a show on Broadway and this one DOESNT disappoint! 	5	4	Broadway experience that is a must	TheOrton4
77	December 17, 2015	The best show we have seen. Everything is spectacular from the acting, the songs to the stage design, costumes and lighting.	21	5	Stunning	William R
107	December 18, 2015	Fantastic show, actors are great, the music is so immortal, they added few songs compared to last time I watched the show. I will be back for sure	51	5	Spectacular indeed	Mikael999
4	December 19, 2015	We saw this for the 3rd time on Broadway and it was as spectacular as the first time !! This was top of my bucket list for NYC & it did not disappoint. Big tick !!!!	16	5	A dream come true	Leesa R
7	December 15, 2015	It was a birthday gift from my kids, I was having a second thought of going thinking that this story is just for kids, but when the show starts me and my husband was stunt because of the voices,costumes,and acting was superb,especially the sound effects were really sensational. I wanted to see it again. I highly recommend for every one to see.	1	5	THE NIGHT OF UNFORGETABLE MAGICAL PERFORMANCE	Maria S
45	December 15, 2015	I took my wife to see the Lion king for her birthday and she loved it. The cast come through the crowd at the beginning and again at the start of the interval. Rafikey (or however it's spelt) and zarzuo were brilliant. But in farness from walking in to the theatre to leaving every member of staff were the nicest people you will ever meet. My wife had a couple of cocktails and they were reasonably priced I however drink cider and not that many places sell it so stuck to a sport that was also well priced. If you have children I would recommend this to you or just as a couple it really is brilliant.	36	5	My first theatre visit	Matthew D
7	December 15, 2015	Best broadway show I've seen yet!! Very colorful, lots of meaning, a definite must-see in NYC. Who hasn't seen the Lion King?? And this show follows the same script as the movie, with all the same songs. Tastefully done.	4	5	Speechless!!	Kfradella 
10	December 15, 2015	Everyone knows what The Lion King is about so no surprises there, but when the lights go down and the curtain comes up, hold on to your seat! Yeah my mouth was hanging open and when it was over I even bought souvenirs (I never by souvenirs). The only sad thing is you can't discuss the show with anyone who hasn't seen it! So tell your friends!	7	5	Ohhhh, Ahhhh ---- this is what you will sound like	Ruckerparknyc
9	December 15, 2015	My son, nephew, brother & I enjoyed the show so much. The songs & music especially the African drums were great! The costumes were perfect. The staging was well thought out & flowed seamlessly. The show was over before we realized that time had elapsed! Highly recommend to all; and especially for the kids in your life.	12	5	Fun musical for all	L C
29	December 15, 2015	I had always been hesitant to see The Lion King, and now I have no idea why I waited so long! This show is stocked full of some amazing talent, costume design, and props. The way the performers are also portrayed as animals was incredible, you see them as the animal but also as the human performer. Great music, great show. 	7	5	One of my favorite broadway shows 	ks_islandgirl
104	December 12, 2015	Perfect for a kids first show. Startling beginning and the excitement just grows. My granddaughter loved every minute if this show.	29	5	A must see	Alan L
5	December 15, 2015	Excellent...the costumes, staging. lighting, sound all adding to the production and making this what ought to be.	1	5	theatre	babzee357
883	December 12, 2015	This is Broadway at its best. I was engrossed the whole time, as was my whole family. This is exactly why we visit New York, You can't get theatre this good anywhere else in the world.	267	5	Best of Class	Daniel K
50	December 12, 2015	I saw The Lion King in 2011 in London and it was amazing, I surprised my 3 boys and they loved it. I suggest sitting in the mezzine although it is expensive.	11	5	Wow	natalie s
19	December 15, 2015	This is without a doubt one of the best Broadway musicals I have ever seen. The costumes were exotic and the performers walk down the aisles during one scene. The music was fabulous and the story kept your interest. Nothing like the cartoon or children's story.	7	5	Exotic costumes/design	DrewYork
110	December 14, 2015	Really, I didn't. I thought that it would be a silly kids story with little or no substance. I was wrong. The story was powerful, the voices superb, the acting was strongly professional and fetching. Above all of that, the costumes and the use of those costumes as a part of the storyline was sensational. You have to see it for yourself. How do they do that?	54	5	I didn't want to go	ANOUL
34	December 2, 2015	Costumes were amazing!!! Although I know the story and songs by heart, I still adored every single minute of it! I will take my kids next time! 	15	5	Fantastic!!!	dpnTravels
15	December 5, 2015	After having seen this show in New York just a few days ago I would recommend anyone to go and see it! Not only are the cast amazing, (youngest member 10) the costumes are out of this world and really let your imagination run away with itself! You would not think you was watching it on a stage, you become engrossed within the story and are fully entertained from start to finish! Vocals, acting, costumes AMAZING	6	5	A must!!!!	Carly-Ann H
16	December 6, 2015	This show is AMAZING!!! Musics, dances, choreography- everything is perfect. I had so great time and I really suggest it to everyone. It is highly recommend that you know the cartoon in advance, but it is a great experience also for the people that don’t know it. MUST SEE!!!	4	5	Best show I have ever been	Dario M
45	December 8, 2015	You know the story and songs, but the performance, dance, costume, and actors will keep you entertained throughout the show. The theater was small so even if we were seated at the far end, we can see everything. No need for binoculars.	13	5	Outstanding production	PinayAko
13	February 28, 2016	Drink coffee before you go, you may fall asleep. The show peaked after the opening number...that's not a good thing. Disney does a great job of over-charging for tickets and overwhelming you with merchandise kiosks, but let's talk about the show. I just saw it today, having not seen it since it opened with the original cast. The costumes are great. The breaking of the fourth wall is really fun. And...that's it. The new songs are unforgettable. In fact, I forgot about them before getting home. I am a big fan of Disney...don't mess with a classic. The Broadway show has Scar hitting on Nala...NO! NO! NO!  Hakuna Matata and Just Can't Wait to be King should be show-stoppers. Instead, they were sleepers. Come on, Disney! And although Julie Taymor is a goddess for how she designed this show, I have no idea what the creatures were in Just Can't Wait...but I wanted Scar to eat them...terrible. Overall, I wish Beauty and the Beast would come back to Broadway...that was true Disney magic, and a tribute to the original animated movie. Maybe the Lion can finally sleep and the Minskoff can hold Frozen in 2018. The show is tired, underwhelming and totally over-priced.	31	2	HAKUNA MA-TOURIST TRAP	Jeff4sonOT
85	March 8, 2016	The lobby of theater has an amazing view of times square. The entrance to the main theater is done with a numbered door system which was very convenient to find our seats. The cast, the songs, the acting and stage was amazing. Possibly me new favorite. Many family members from youth to adults loved the souvenir store. Bring some serious cash if you want some memorabilia. The down side was we had several teens in our group. They policy is super strict on photos. So any time one of the kids took their phones out (aside effect of being a teen these days) not necessarily for a picture the usher crawled or ran over which made the situation 10 times more distracting. It would have been better if he had used his time to tell some of the audience to be quite. Nonetheless the show is so well done, I'm considering going again! Some of our family went before and they were pleased that things were updated, changed or improved. 	43	5	Great show!! One of my new favorites!! 	Jazzypaparazzi
57	March 13, 2016	i took my daughter and our African exchange student to see The Lion King while on spring break and we all Loved it!!!! The costumes, singing, and dancing made us forget we were at a play. We were completely immersed in the story. I especially liked the characters entering from the theater aisles. This is a must see!!! Also, we sat very close to the stage but the theater is not huge so there are no bad seats.	24	5	A feast for the Senses!	SCgirlatheart1
25	March 15, 2016	You absolutely can't go wrong with this show. Family? Great. Romantic date? Perfect. On your own? Enjoy the night! It truly is for everyone. 	11	5	A Broadway Classic and Must See!	Texalunya
149	April 25, 2016	I have been blessed with the op to go to shows since I was ten. I was not anticipating that I would feel this way, because of all the hoopla, but it is positively my lifetime favorite! I have been twice. Outstanding, on every level, music, theme, sets, costumes. If you can only go to one show, let this be it.	33	5	My favorite show of all time.	Jane E
5	April 28, 2016	I'd been looking forward to see Lion King for years but we came away so disappointed. We sat in the second balcony but still had a great view of the stage. The problem was the sound mix. The music was louder than the singers so we missed virtually all of the sung dialogue. Maybe it sounded great down on the floor level... I don't know, but I expected better sound mixing on Broadway	8	3	I really wanted to love this show	Duncan_Lori
15	March 28, 2016	It's an experience out of this world. The performance is absolutely stunning from people on stage to escenography. Really touching for anyone who has seen the movie.	4	5	Lion King: Feeling like a child again	agosb
55	May 12, 2016	Probably the best thing I have ever seen. Celebrated my 50th birthday. The show was amazing from start to finish. Only bad part was the over priced drinks.	22	5	Absolutely amazing 	Helen E
124	May 20, 2016	I took my granddaughter on her 7th-year BD on a Saturday (5/14) matinee. It was one of the best experiences of our lives. The actors come strolling down the aisles in their animal costumes and full tribal garb...they are amazing. My granddaughter and I were both agape as we first them...and continued to be filled with awe and wonder at the puppetry and creativeness of the entire show. The actors were amazing!! Yes, I know I use the word amazing a lot but you have to see it to understand. Seeing a Disney animated movie come to life is always a wonderful experience, but the way they did it on stage was truly a memorable one. I know I'm the best Nana to my granddaughter for giving her the gift of her first Broadway show, and she is looking forward to her next show! (P.S., She wants to come back to see The Lion King for her 8th BD!). 	38	5	Amazing Play and Effects!	Amorito43
51	May 31, 2016	Plain and simple- go see it, go see it, go see it!  Excellent staging, costumes, acting and singing. My dad had never seen a musical before and I'm glad I could take him to Broadway to see this as his first. Put it on your bucket list! 	13	5	One of the best musicals of all time!	Robert R
42	June 13, 2016	This show is fantastic in every way! The acting, costumes, music...just the best experience for both children and adults. This was our first Broadway show and we were mesmerized the whole way through. The show is about 2 1/2 hours long with a 15 minute intermission. I was worried it may be a little long for my 7-year-old, but not at all. You get totally immersed in the story, you truly cannot describe it, you have to experience it. This was the best thing we did in NYC, in fact, one of the best things we ever attended as a family. The tickets are pricey but worth every penny! We sat in the balcony maybe 6 rows back, seats were great in my opinion. Forever memories! Oh and leave quickly afterwards and go to Junior's next door for cheesecake! If you go quickly you can beat the line. :)	26	5	Fantastic!	mboudreaux
103	June 21, 2016	I am NEVER this harsh.. but c'mon... this is BROADWAY!!! There IS talent in this show but it isn't from any of the main characters. The children and lead adults are lacking horribly. The instruments and african songs were on point and blew me away. I just can't get past the rest. If I were at a high school play... I would rave. With all of the talented people yearned to perform on broadway.. I'm really disappointed. We will never see this show again. Wicked offers off the charts talent. Stomp is also a fun show.	36	2	Disappointed in the vocals.	Erica C
99	June 29, 2016	This show is not to be missed! Elephants walking in the isles, birds flying overhead, an incredibly talented stage of performers combined with beautiful voices and a sound orchestra! WOW!! What a performance!  This show is for all ages!	12	5	Amazing!	JohnandKristy
109	July 14, 2016	Took the whole family to the Lion King for their first NYC Broadway show. The show was fantastic! Everyone in the family was amazed by the costumes and quality of the show. Tickets for this show are pretty expensive but worth every penny. Its also nice to be able to take any age family member and know the content of the show is good for younger children.	65	5	First Show for our Family	memullinax
178	July 25, 2016	We missed out on watching this show when it toured our home city so we made it a priority to watch it when holidaying recently in New York. Suffice to say it was one of the best shows we have ever seen. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely recommended.	40	5	Fantastic	Itterom67
74	July 27, 2016	People rave about this show for a reason...it's unbelievable. Be sure when you go that you try for aisle seats in either the orchestra or balcony as a great deal of the show takes place in these areas. Love the music and dance. Everything is wonderful. Souvenirs were actually not too unreasonable either.	26	5	One of the best shows ever!	atarzia
44	August 3, 2016	Of course I have seen lion king via the Disney cartoon but the show is a much more intimate experience. The costumes and life given to the characters by actors is something you must see to understand. Especially if this is your first time enjoying a Broadway play. 	43	5	We loved this show	Prentis R
181	August 3, 2016	This was our fourth time attending The Lion King on Broadway. It is a fantastic play that has had subtle changes over the years. Disney missed the boat by not adding more women's washrooms - they need three times as many. One area of hesitation is trying to park at the garage next to the Minskoff - It was the worst experience parking ever in New York.	45	5	fantastic play to attend	bobbdn
95	August 4, 2016	We treated ourselves to this musucal and we loved it!  Yes, it's a bit pricey but it's worth every penny! If you love Disney thus is a must see! The costumes are fantastic, the dialogues hilarious and just a true piece of art!  We had a blast and recommend it to everyone!	35	5	Great fun!	RahelRich
691	August 4, 2016	I have always wanted to see the show on Broadway. But Mufasa forgot his lines he was supposed to say take Nala home instead he said Simba. I think that the one in Disney World is better. Even though the little girl that plays Nala, she was really good. 	254	3	He forget his lines	Irene M
76	August 7, 2016	Saw the movie many times with my kids, so when we were in NYC it was a good chance to (finally) see a broadway show. We chose this one, and we were not dissapointed. Excellent singing, nice effects. Great experience to see this as a stage place. Tickets up front can be pricey but it was worth every penny !	13	5	Sensational	AFStatie
54	July 30, 2016	Don't even hesitate about spending the money to see this- it is amazing from start to finish! The music, the costumes, the choreography- everything! Go and see it for sure!	26	5	Spend the money!	Elizabeth B
29	July 30, 2016	It is the best Broadway musical I have ever been. It took me a while to convince my husband to go but he agreed with me that it was worth it. Very enjoyable show l recommend to everyone. 	4	5	No need to give any reviews because it is fantastic!	Nilgun A
33	August 1, 2016	We enjoyed watching the Lion King in this theatre very much. I had read about seating. We had seats in the right mezzanine first row and they were perfect. We enjoyed watching the percussionists throughout the show. My son and husband had an orchestra aisle seat and they said their few was wonderful especially as the characters filed in the beginning and a little later in the show.	11	4	Just right for scorching day in July.	Kkiimm
43	July 31, 2016	"FINALLY got to see ""The Lion King""! Even though we had tickets in the next to the last row in the balcony, this show was superb! A friend had told me to not miss the first 5 minutes of the show--and I was not disappointed! So impressed with the puppetry, costumes, set, and special effects. MUST SEE!"	9	5	Checked One Off My Bucket List!	cruisintheusa
47	July 25, 2016	its a very impressive and beautiful production..... everyone must see it at least once! you will ansolutely enjoy it.....	6	5	A Must	mim a
3	July 26, 2016	Had a great time seeing a production of The Lion King this past Saturday evening. Lively, unique, colorful and entertaining! Truly a must see for visitors to the Big Apple!	41	5	The Lion King!	19HollyBolly
17	July 26, 2016	Everything is wonderful in the show. Saw it twice: NY and Toronto. Enjoyed the music, acting, staging and the costumes. I hope it plays forever.	1	5	A great show	travelagent811
125	July 27, 2016	"Visited on a Tuesday night. Myself and my partner loved the whole show. We had seats in a ""box"" which turned out not to be a box it's more a ledge. They were great viewing seats though and I'd recommend them as you get a fantastic view. The member of staff on the door was very friendly too and chatted to us for a little while during the break. Hakuna Matata!"	35	5	Brilliant production	adaminspain
70	July 15, 2016	Beautiful scenery and great performance of the artist.  The animals are so creative how they made it, amazing work.  The songs are as usual perfectly well performed by the characters.  A must go!!	22	5	Very nice Musical	Sebastián C
51	July 19, 2016	Having watched the DVD many times as my children grew up I knew I would enjoy the show. But I had no idea that it would be so amazing, my first Broadway show and I loved every second. A must for families!	7	5	Absolutely Amazing	sarahd782
4	July 21, 2016	So just finishing up my first trip to NYC, and last night I went to see this show. It was absolutely amazing. So glad I went. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story, well the show is still an experience I would highly recommend. The talent of the performers and the way the show is put together, it's an extraordinary feat of imagination and ingenuity. The atmosphere is fantastic.	3	5	Great Show	Dan S
64	July 24, 2016	The shot was absolutely beautiful. The costumes were spectacular. And it was a wonderful trip down memory lane to watching this movie as a kid. The actors, the music, the theatre, everything was phenomenal. Worth every penny. I sat about 15 rows back in the center, great seating. It is a small theatre, so I imagine you will be fine anywhere you sit.	31	5	What a fantastic show	Stephanie M
44	July 1, 2016	All of my family (me, wife, two boys 8 & 13) was blown away. Performance, the set, the costumes were all outstanding. All of the praise the musical gets is well deserved. If you have the money I would highly recommend to see this. 	21	5	Awesome!!!!	feldjoe
35	July 3, 2016	You cannot visit New York and not see a Broadway show - particularly a Broadway Musical Show. I picked this out as a possible and booked before arrival. The theatre website has a method of seeing your view from your selected seat before booking. Suffice to say, the performance was excellent in every way. After a few minutes, you forget you are seeing humans as you are in the midst of the Savannah. Highly recommended	10	5	Amazing!	James F
1	July 6, 2016	I loved it! Everything about this show is fantastic!! The costumes the actors the music the dancers the signing!! Super! 	215	5	Fantastic!	Maxim P
81	July 10, 2016	This was the best show my eyes have ever seen, from the first second until the end i was mesmerized by the quality of the show.  Once it ended we wanted to watch the Broadway show again however we had booked aladin.  All the seat at great so get the cheapest tickets and you will be fine.	31	5	What an amazing show	Naz T
164	June 24, 2016	"Wow!! Before we went, my 13 year old son asked why it cost so much to go to a show. He asked what the big deal was about going to a Broadway show. I told him that he would see. After the show, he exclaimed, ""It gave me goosebumps "" All four of my children loved it! They are 15, 13, 10, and 7. My wife got tears in her eyes it was so good!  This show was the best show I have ever seen on Broadway!"	51	5	6 Stars!	Greg H
125	June 27, 2016	The best live show I've ever seen, it's so moving and stunning. Considering it's based on an animation, its so well done! Loved it. 	14	5	Amazing	ashleighnicolem
179	June 27, 2016	This was a great show and the costumes were phenomenal! We got some sangria at intermission and they were served in huge plastic sippy cups... And I loved that! 	57	5	Amazing Costumes	Kelley R
15	June 27, 2016	When I started watching I thought: Man, I'm too old to this kind of show, but then when you see a couple of people doing their best in dancing, singing.. or body movements , when you see the brighting eyes you get so envolved.. that you feel part of the show! Just Amazing	2	5	No doubt a must see in NYC	laistierno
21	June 16, 2016	My family and I saw this show on a Saturday evening and it was the perfect way to end the day. The adaptation of the movie is true to the story, but with some clever changes. The production of this show is simply stunning. Visually, it's a gorgeous masterpiece that makes brilliant use of color and space. The costumes are on point and the set pieces really draw you into the atmosphere. The actors performed flawlessly, with real heart and emotion. The length and pacing were just right and transitions between scenes felt very natural. It's great fun for the whole family. The theater itself is quite nice and easy to navigate. I've been in New York for almost a decade but never got around to seeing this Broadway. I'm glad I finally did.	7	5	Spectacular Show	Garland Q
230	June 17, 2016	It almost seems sacrilegious to say this wasn't great. But really, aside from the amazing animals, it really wasn't all that great. The singers voices were OK with a few exceptions. The the guy that did Zazu was amazing the guy that did Timon was amazing and the woman who did the witch doctor was amazing. Other than that not so much. Great for kids though.	56	3	Average 	CS124578
74	June 19, 2016	This show is a must watch, The production is quite breathtaking, Very funny in places, Its simply brilliant.	86	5	simply brilliant	matt_hayley
117	June 19, 2016	My husband and I saw this show years ago and took our 9&10 year old boys to see it today. I can still remember their faces through the show. Well worth the price you pay to see it. Loved it. 	35	5	Excellent 	Viajandosevive
28	June 1, 2016	We had a great time, the show is wonderful and worth every dollar spent, I recommend it very much. We were lucky to buy tickets the same day, at the theater which is always an option, but you take your chances. 	6	5	Great time	horca17
77	June 5, 2016	Great show for all the family. Very colourful and entertaining. Thought the theatre was really good and plenty of leg room.	12	5	Fantastic show	Pamgraham1
14	June 8, 2016	We turned up an hour before the show and it was fully booked so we waited for cancellations. Luckily we got two tickets and they were in prime position. This show is best summed up by two words powerful and emotional. It follows the cartoon well and all the scenes and animals are portrayed in ways I couldn't imagine but were visually impeccable. If you are in NYC you need to go!!!!!!	8	5	Absolutely amazing!!!!	Joe B
227	June 11, 2016	 I actually detest musicals, so I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I came. The theatre is quite nice. I do think that the merchandise inside of the theatre is expensive. The musical itself is excellent. The dancing and the costumes are fantastic. This is a great musical for all ages. The tickets were also on the more expensive side, but I would see the musical again.	63	5	Very Enjoyable	Keaton C
39	May 29, 2016	Tickets to this show are expensive and from what my friend told me never go on sale. We loved the show. Costumes and sets were amazing! Out of the two I did prefer Aladdin as a show. But both were good. 	9	4	Great show! 	sara s
7	May 25, 2016	Even if you do not enjoy the theatre, you will enjoy the Lion King. The costumes and portrayal of the animals is so well done. They must have studied the characteristics of the animals very closely.	2	5	One of the most fascinating theatre shows	925beverlyd
54	May 29, 2016	Special treat paid for by a very kind relative, would have been way too much for us as a family of five in a weeks stay in NYC.  However it really lived up to the hype. Amazing costumes, great music and fantastic performances! We all loved it from 5 to 40 something.  Really nice theater and helpful staff. 	11	5	Looked amazing sounded fantastic! 	Northernshrimp123
150	May 31, 2016	Came here during Easter weekend and got a seat at the front Mezzanine. The show itself was awesome but the seat was less than what I expected. It was a little far from the state. So could be missing the details of the show. So I think a premium seat will be so much better experience.	32	4	Great Disney Classic 	Kristen L
89	May 14, 2016	We finally made our first trip to NYC. Lion King was the one show we all wanted to see. It was great! Animals puppets are amazing. Well worth the cost of the tickets. 	29	5	Great Show	Raymond M
159	May 16, 2016	This was amazing! All of the animals in the performance is incredible. So much going on and you sit there so amazed. The costumes are awesome as well. Just so you, you HAVE to see it.	23	5	Wow, incredible 	c22hubb
90	May 18, 2016	I had booked these tickets in December last year and we finally got to go last night. Front row seats to an amazing production. Costumes were amazing, movie storyline followed perfectly (so if you are a fan of the movie you will know all the lines) and the sets are amazing.  The talent in this show is outstanding and love how they interact with the audience. This is a MUST SEE.. Theatre isn't that big so no bad seats in the house. 	28	5	Unbelievable 	deewill47
16	May 18, 2016	I've been waiting to see this show for years. It was so worth the wait. I loved the music and especially the costumes. They were amazing. I highly recommend this show. 	2	5	Fabulous 	Marthammax
46	March 31, 2016	Magnificent staging, costumes, and props. Refreshing adaptation from the beloved movie. Though it is tailored for younger audiences, it is still highly entertaining for adults. The story line is light to digest and easy to follow. On our recent trip, we brought our, then, 3 year old son who has a hard time staying still, but this time around he was mesmerized and pay attention the whole time, even was fighting his nap time to not miss a thing from Lion King. Would come back again!	16	5	Magical, Everytime!	Arya W
23	April 5, 2016	This show has been on Broadway for years and tours around the world. That said, the performance on Broadway is the best. The theatre is designed for this show. Costumes, centerpieces, orchestra, the whole environment one another is without a doubt one of the best Broadway experiences you will ever have. Disney knows what they are doing.	6	5	Wow! This is an experience!!	Dante S
55	April 7, 2016	We saw the show last night and thought it was amazing. Some people have said its more aimed at families but I would say it's great for anyone! There were loads of couples and there wasn't anything not to enjoy! It was bright, colourful, excellent music, what more could you want! 	43	5	Amazing - go see it!	LittleMissSunshine45
98	April 10, 2016	First time seeing The Lion King for both me and the friend I was with. We bought tickets well in advance and had pretty decent seats. Tickets were pricey but as expected for a show in NYC so I'm not complaining. The show was unreal though, the voices, the costumes, the use of the stage, all of it was so great to take in. There is something to be said about seeing a show in a theatre that was built around the show. Makes a huge difference.  I loved it so much that I wouldn't hesitate to see it again! It's also a great start to the night - the timing of the show was perfect.	63	5	Amazing Production	ACCTD14
116	April 29, 2016	It's superb place to visit, very well managed & maintained, statues of lion looks veryb beautiful....	14	5	Lion roar!!!	Rikhab D
97	May 1, 2016	Amazing performance! From the talented performers to the staging, costumes, set design, and the music, everything was as good as it gets. Three generations all loved this show! Even though it has been around awhile and the music and story might be familiar, this is a must see for musical theatre fans. 	33	5	Must see if you like Broadway musicals	Hilary T
15	May 7, 2016	"The tickets were very expensive but we did not regret any cent of it. My favorite moment is when they start to sing ""the Circle of Life"". We are caught by the ambiance immediately."	5	5	Two weeks after having seen the show and I am still thinking about it	John L
17	May 10, 2016	This is a must see for everyone! It is truly one of the best shows on Broadway. I took my grandsons ( 8&10 ) and the joy on their faces was worth the price of admission!	5	5	Amazing Performance!	mayh0905
16	April 25, 2016	Honestly the best show I have ever seen. Absolutely a must see, 10/10. Everything from costumes to acting was worth the ticket price. Couldn't recommend it enough! 	10	5	Wow. Wow. Wow!	deanmcdonnell
25	April 26, 2016	This is really best broadway show , i ever see it. i did recommend a lot of friends to visit it. You will like the music too. don't miss this show, while your are in NY.	5	5	Broadway show must visit in NY	UPSET0913
140	April 26, 2016	My mother-in-law treated us girls to a trip in December (three women 40-44, two girls under 14, and my awesome MIL), and this was her top pick of shows. Wow, I sure know why. My little one (six) had a little pad to sit on so she could see everything, and she loved every second of it, as did we. I would go back again!	43	5	GREAT cast, great experience!	Kelly B
99	April 27, 2016	This show was even better than expected! Loved every second. The animal costumes were incredible, singing and acting superb. Must see! 	29	5	Amazing!	Heather W
204	April 14, 2016	This is one of the best shows I've ever seen. I wasn't expecting much but was blown away by the whole production. It's excellent	109	5	One of the best shows I've ever seen	Kevin M
106	April 16, 2016	I was never in love with the lion king, but tickets were cheap so I went. IT wasn't my first Broadway show and luckily not my last. There are very mixed reviews and feelings. IT's a musical on Broadway, so of course the singers were talented and the storyline was good. I just couldn't get into it because of the whole animal mask/heads that they would randomly take on and off in the middle of the play. One minute, they'd be singing with their lion head on top of their human head (which was facepainted) and the next they would just decapitate themselves. I couldn't really get into it. 	41	3	It's a love it, hate it sort of thing	Michelle M
111	April 17, 2016	My sons first broadway show!! Ar the age of 2... she sat n the edge of the chair in amazement!!!!! What a awesome show!  The theater is small which makes all the seats good seats. Liln King is for the young and old at heart. My mom came with us and she enjoyed herself also.	60	5	A great start for a young cub!	OurTripTip4U
9	April 19, 2016	I guess coming from Las Vegas and seeing Cirq shows I just don't quite understand Broadway, I mean for over $200 a ticket, and $20 cocktails this show was suppose to blow my socks off but was like a children's play and fell asleep half way through. I love good live shows, Broadway, but I guess having been to Vegas in the past this just wasn't up to my standards.. not sure what I was expecting or looking for I guess. I mean It's the Lion King alright re-interpreted through song and dance but the prices are outrageous for the quality of this performance.. I mean this day at least it seemed no one really cared to live up to its hype. Will def be a few years before I ever attend a Broadway show.. I'll stick with Cirque De Soleil for now.	10	3	Eh, not what I expected	ChillinFood
364	April 24, 2016	After avoiding this show for years (how enjoyable could a cartoon turned play with human puppets really be), I was in awe.  The artistry, the stage translation, etc was, literally, jaw-dropping. Granted there were time when I just thought, can we move on, but overall I was amazed.  I fully plan to take the little ones in my family to see it as soon as it is possible. 	136	5	unbelivable	KatieG958
27	March 19, 2016	The opening act is truly amazing! Great from beginning to end. Great talent from all involved. Perfect seats on 6th row. The orchestra and drummers were superb!	5	5	Awesome!	Mary E
50	March 23, 2016	You will be blown away by the play. Seriously it is that good. We happened to purchase an after show backstage tour for a fundraiser and it really pulled back the curtain on the effort and expertise that make this play so consistently good. Money well spent.	11	5	Whhoooaaa Simba!!!	HDintheATX
9	March 25, 2016	For a Broadway presentation, I expected more. The actor playing Rafiki was the saving grace vocally, for me. She was the highlight of the show even though she really wasn't in it very much. All the remaining cast seemed to struggle vocally, or not to be on their A game. I'm hoping I saw an off-night (maybe there were sound issues?!) A lot of the costumes and scenery were absolutely beautiful. It did seem that some of the scenes were just filler and added nothing to the presentation, especially after the amazing opening number.  Overall, I did enjoy the show, but it wasn't the must-see masterpiece I was expecting. I am the first to admit that I am a very hard critic when it comes to Broadway. Broadway is supposed to be the best of the best and that's what I expect to see for the prices that are charged for tickets.	8	3	Average	TPotter115
28	March 27, 2016	This show kept my 5 year old in awe as well as the rest of the family. The acting, singing and overall performance was excellent! As a first time Broadway experience for my 5 and 10 year old girls I know we picked the best option. They are now Broadway fans, can't wait to see what we get to choose next time we are in NYC.	9	5	Great Broadway Show For The Family	Chelby A
88	March 27, 2016	Wow, what an incredible show, we had great seats 5 rows from the front, whilst the tickets are quite pricy, it soon becomes evident from the fantastic costumes, make up, orchestra etc that this is well worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed this and would highly recommend this to others.	21	5	Fantastic experiance	Dave C
62	March 15, 2016	The young in our group were really into this play. The older ones had trouble following the plot. If one knows the characters and their background, the story is splendid. All the under 20 youngsters in our group came away excitedly chattering about how really engaging the production turned out to be.	22	4	Best for folks who are familiar with the characters	Hal S
17	March 17, 2016	What a fantastic show, the costumes, make-up, actors and sets were superb. Loved it from start to finish. The seats were fantastic, 4 rows from the front, expensive but worth every penny. 	14	5	Amazing!!!	Lisa N
1	February 29, 2016	Could someone please helps us by telling where is the best place for lion king tickets? Spending the Easter week in NYC . & never been before. Any tips or advise greatly appreciated.	30	4	Help needed	Paul C
135	March 5, 2016	The Lion King is an amazing show and needless to say it is the best musical show.. Every penny spent is worth it! Simply amazing.. The artists are super talented and the show is a must watch! I would love to watch it again..	52	5	Amazing!	Aisha214
8	March 6, 2016	 If you wait till the last minute to purchase these tickets, you will likely pay for regular seating at orchestra seating prices! Great show!	3	5	Seats Go Quickly!	Ltraveler38
108	March 8, 2016	The most incredible show I have ever seen... The production of the show is fantastic and the costumes are great. All in all a great evening and I would definite return and urge others to go too!	58	5	Amazing !	RLD_133
55	August 8, 2016	Great show, hands down. Please make sure to pay attention to the ushers as you make you way to the doors entering the theatre - they do get a bit feisty if you do not follow instructions.	20	5	Great show	Brady_ADV
66	August 20, 2016	This was brilliant, just brilliant! i am still applauding. The actors, the performances, the set - everything is just too good! I loved the movie and was worried that I would not like this as much because of it - and boy, was I wrong - coz I totally loved it!!!	13	5	Oh so amazing!!!	PinksLovesToTravel
13	January 31, 2017	I took my 12 year old daughter and 72 year old mother to see The Lion King at the Miskoff Theatre. The theatre was very nice and the staff was friendly. The show was fantastic. Very entertaining!! The costumes were so well done and the characters were great. We thought that Scar was really good and that Zazu made the show funny. Young Simba and Nala were great as well. We were so impressed by the young actor and actress portraying them. We had one aisle seat which was great because many of the characters came down the aisle next to us. I would highly recommend this show!	6	5	Amazing Show	Jill P
13	February 9, 2017	I have been to shows and concerts before, but never something like this! The show was out of this world. The actors, dancers, everybody was amazing. There was a lot of effort in the production. All staff in the theatre were friendly and pleasant. drinks weren't massively expensive either which is always a plus. 	17	5	Absolutely out of this world	Mitch9192
70	February 17, 2017	I would give this more than excellent if I could. From the moment the musical starts you are swept away in the singing, the characters, the whole production. I loved every minute of it. My six year old daughter was hanging onto the edge of her seat. I would recommend this to everyone and would see it again.	40	5	WONDERFUL	angela c
56	March 2, 2017	There is magic in The Lion King. The music is beautifully composed and actors pour their heart and soul into the performance. I look forward to watching it again, this time as an adult.	20	5	Crying tears of joy	Kim E
193	March 18, 2017	So being a Disney lover my whole life, and having grown up with The Lion King as one of my favorite films, I went in to the play with very low expectations. But I must say that they did such a wonderful job bringing every scene to life! It was vibrant, rich, and captivating! I loved every minute of it!	57	5	Way better than expected!	Elizabeth A
26	April 8, 2017	I have been to this show twice, 10 years apart. It was awesome both times. While most of the show is on the stage, a couple of times the actors will come down the aisles and perform in the audience. We had an aisle seat, so it was great to get that up close to the action. Obviously, this is a family friendly show, but wouldn't suggest for very small kids. I think they suggest no children under 4. Note, this is a long show, so need to make sure any kids you bring can sit still for a while. While I don't remember every little detail from 10 years ago, I could tell they had updated some of the lines, as there were references to movies and events that weren't around 10 years ago. So, that was cool. Great Show!!!	14	5	Great Show for all	Starslover07
21	April 26, 2017	By far worth every penny. I took my 5 year old daughter (age recommendation is 6-but she is mature) to see the show but in reality I always wanted to see it myself. I splurged and got seats 4 rows from the stage and it was worth it. I have never seen any show that was so amazing. The performers, musicians, ...everyone was spot on! The visuals and music were fantastic. Parts of the show were so beautiful it brought tears to my eyes. I absolutely loved every minute and my daughter did as well. I would highly recommend to everyone. If you are taking children try to get seats on the aisle they will be amazed. I cannot wait to see it again. 	1	5	Breathtaking 	Sonya K
26	May 13, 2017	We saw this in Sydney a couple of years ago, it was that amazing that we decided to see it again when we were in New York. It didn't let us down, amazing once again. Must see!	12	5	Best show there is	bpepper13
37	May 25, 2017	From the opening parade until the curtain call and final notes from the orchestra, the Lion King was stunning! It was visually spectacular with jaw-dropping costumes and sets and the actors/singers were absolutely fantastic and top-notch! My wife and I both were enthralled with the whole experience. We sat on the front row and thoroughly enjoyed the close-up view. (I read some reviews about front row seating limiting the visual experience, but I think just the opposite is true. We could see the details of the costumes and sets and see the actors' facial expressions with great clarity. Plus we got to see the conductor and pit orchestra!) Families will LOVE this show. We could not have enjoyed the Lion King any more and give it an AAA+++!	16	5	OFF THE CHARTS!	Sumner S
107	June 9, 2017	This was my first time seeing the Lion King, and I was blown away! Everything from the acting, to the singing, to the costumes, to the choreography, to the percussion players, to the orchestra was absolutely fabulous! I've seen the Disney movie countless times and this followed the plot and score very closely. There are a few songs that are not in the movie. Definitely family friendly. This was so good, I'm seeing it again this summer when the touring company comes to my hometown!	41	5	Fantastic production!	bluebonnet-and-bat
52	June 20, 2017	Amazing performance! We were literally speechless with the songs, the choerography, the costumes and the sets! Magical voices, very talented artists!	11	5	Unique Experience	Eirini02

240	July 21, 2017	"My wife and I went to see the Broadway play ""Lion King"". It was amazing! It helps as one of my favorite Disney movies is the ""Lion King"". The play didn't disappoint. As the play was just spectacular. This is a play which all ages can enjoy and see from age 7 or 8 and up. I liked I could get a drink and have it in a sippie cup as things can easily spill and it was a nice souvenir to take home too. I would highly recommend on seeing this play."	23	5	Great Broadway Experience	jeffwU2958ED
9	August 3, 2017	Why would u kick a 2 years old out of the show after paying a full price of usd 140. Didnt it say show is for all ages and no early information that if ur daughter get exited by being laughing and calling zimba, she will be kicked out.	13	3	Dissapointing	Gs002921
51	August 10, 2017	I cannot recommend this show enough! Well worth every penny. Just incredible. The costumes, the puppetry, the music, the acting--all of it was just amazing!	17	5	Absolutely Amazing!	Cathie C
118	August 13, 2017	People hate on Disney as being too squeaky clean, but, personally, I give Disney credit for its incredible attention to detail. This play is no exception. The entire theater is used--sights and sounds come from every direction. There is so much going on at once that you can't even take it all in. The visuals/staging are INCREDIBLE. The costumes are beautiful. The giraffes and hyenas are especially well done to convey the animals' shapes and movements, though all of the animals are well done. The music is enchanting. The colors and images are magical. The acting is well done and the singing is even better. I especially loved Scar, played to villainous perfection, with wonderful use of the mask. The child actors were quite talented and professional caliber, which is not always the case, even on Broadway. Of course, the adult performers were exceptional. The story is not great, but entirely adequate as a basis for the play, but it is the sensory experience and memorable songs that make this show worth every penny you spend on tickets. Incredibly well crafted, down to the most minute detail.	54	5	A sensory feast	distortiongirl
2	August 15, 2017	This was an amazing show. We had a great time! The kids really enjoyed the show as well. I was worried that they would get tired and fall asleep because it was a long show but nope they stayed up the whole time. They were singing along, clapping and were very happy to be there. I would definitely recommend.	19	5	Amazing show!	taburish21
72	August 16, 2017	"First, the great - the ""spectacle"" of Lion King is in the category of ""Greatest of All Time"". The costumes, the entrance of the cast at the beginning of the show, a huge stage that does anything you can imagine (tilt, spin, multiple platforms going up and down), all of the production is just over the top incredible. It's the reason you go to see Lion King. That said, once you get past that (and yes, I know that's a lot to get past), it's really no better than an average show. Any truly great Broadway show has a great lead. A Jean Valjean, an Elhphaba or Grizabella, an Alexander Hamilton. Lion King really lacks in that category. There are no memorable solos, the top billed actor is actually the guy who plays Scar. He's the only featured actor that's present in both acts. Sure, there are ensemble songs......but I'd challenge anyone to name even one memorable solo in Lion King. Great spectacle, great ensemble, but lacking that truly memorable lead or star, it's only an average show, certainly not in the same league as those other shows I mentioned (Les Mis, Wicked, Cats, Hamilton) that have both the spectacle and the star."	139	3	All Spectacle, No Star	crnd
263	August 17, 2017	"Wow. Just wow.  I'm not much of a theatre goer to be honest; don't particularly enjoy musicals either but as my wife and I had booked to go to NY, I thought a Broadway show would be a must-see and must-do while there.  I purchased tickets online in advance several months before and managed to snag excellent (in my opinion the best) seats located on the upper of two levels, front and centre. This, did pay off for the view was excellent and allowed you to see the whole stage in comfort and ease. Yes, tickets for expensive (over £300!) which is arguably appalling but I wanted to surprise my wife.  We approached the theatre on the evening and my wife still didn't know where we were going. I just told her we'd have a wander around Times Square and then get an evening meal. Then, as she saw the various billboards and mentioned Broadway, I thought she might have mentioned how much she'd like to see a show different to the one I'd booked. ""I'd love to see the Lion King,"" she said and I felt a sense of relief. It wasn't until we got into the theatre and strolled past a pre-purchase tickets that she suspected anything and still wondered up until I pulled the paperwork out of my pocket.  Anyway enough about us. Wow. The show was amazing. The singers and actors are incredible. The way they make the whole theatre feel like you could actually be there in the jungle is stunning. It is a whole sensory experience. I won't spoil the show but take the stampede scene for instance! How on earth could you replicate that on stage?! Well they do - and they do it VERY well. The costumes, scenery and props etc. are incredible - this is a big budget performance and the music/percussion is outstanding. The talent on display on stage was spectacular.  We bought a couple of beers (mega bucks to be honest but we bought a second round as you get re-usable plastic Lion King cups so wanted two for our children who'd stayed back home in the UK) and enjoyed the show.  Highly recommended!!!!"	156	5	Not my usual kind of things but...	David M
596	August 6, 2017	Attending with my two granddaughters was very special as we were transported to a magical place by this amazing production. The actors, costumes, singing and uplifting music felt truly like a broadway musical at its best. I love children and enjoy their noise almost anywhere but not in expensive theatre seats. Very young children clearly couldn't sit through this quietly and quite honestly, why should they? However, why bring them to a show that starts at 7pm? Perhaps, like some enlightened cinemas there should be a toddlers matinee so the rest of us can enjoy an adults night out. Hope they consider that for future shows.	415	5	Excellent production but maybe there should be special shows for toddlers	Peytonsage
9	August 7, 2017	This was show was super awesome! From the singing to the costumes! I was just blown away. A must see!	1	5	Super Awesome!!! Enjoyed it very much!!!!	missladyjr
226	August 8, 2017	 The best show on Broadway, the costumes are amazing and the story is well performed live. Nothing comes close to this and you'll want to see it again. 	86	5	 Best show ever!!	TravelBuddy80
16	August 10, 2017	I was hesitant to go see the Lion King, since the movie is perfect and I didnt want to spoil my memories but boy was I surprised. The music is perfect and the actors are great. I loves the kids playing young nala and simba and laught my butt off with timon, pumba, zazu; even Scar and the heines were extremely funny. I truly recommend going. 	1	5	Great family fun	Gabriela A
95	July 22, 2017	It was my third time to NYC and despite having seen the Lion King twice before (May 2005 and January 2012), my partner really wanted to see it again. I have to say I was a bit unenthusiastic about going to see it again and really fancied trying something else. I cried from the opening. I had to hide my sobbing from everyone else because I appeared to be the only one crying! Some people cry on closing but if a show can make you teary from the start then you know it's b****y good! The props, the singing, the theatre, everything was absolutely fantastic. I enjoyed even more than the previous times. We paid $215 for premium seats (which we hoped would be worth it) and they were worth every penny (or cent if you're American). If you're unsure become sure with this review!!!! 	65	5	Absolutely phenomenal 	lozorro92
21	July 30, 2017	Yes, it is expensive, but so very worth it. Words cannot express how magnificent this show is.....the tears rolling down my face during the opening & closing numbers say it all!	13	5	The Lion King	didntwant2join
172	July 31, 2017	We liked it. I went with my 17yrs old, a Sunday, at 6h30PM. There was a lot of little kids and it was a little annoying to ear chatting the whole show. So beware of matinee and early show. At 8PM you have better chances to NOT get little voices in your back. Want a drink at intermission..? be ready to wait in line forever. I got my drink 5 minutes after the 2nd show started. There was 1x bartender. I thought it was ridiculous for a place like NYC. I am a big fan of Cirque du Soleil for their costumes, shows, music and most of all the entire visual, and I was a tiny bit disappointed in the Lion King visual, sometimes it was great sometimes its like there was dancers missing to fill the empty spot. We enjoyed it but No more kids-musical for us. Minskoff theater is right across the Mariott Marquis hotel. 	83	4	Liked it.	Nancy B
139	August 3, 2017	The problem I have is not in the show. It is something special and very good. The price is too high for the show. I think it does not reflect the show you see,	41	4	The show is fantastic	YarivI
29	July 10, 2017	My family and I enjoyed this show. The music was great and performance was fantastic. The theater was nice and great. This show is great for all age range. Even I think languages do not matter to follow and enjoy this show. If non-English speaking people want to enjoy this show more, I recommend them to watch the movie of Lion King before this show. I believe that's enough. My 5-year-old nephew who does not know English enjoyed and followed the story. He loved this show!!!	4	5	Entertaining and amazing!	nugunii
12	July 10, 2017	the lion king was an absolute amazing show myself and my girlfriend managed to be very lucky to get titckets the night before as we wanted to view the show on our last night of our holiday, we got what we thought was the best seats in house which was orchestra and for the extra charge you really do get the best! From the moment the curtains opened to the the moment the curtains closed my eyes were glued to the stage there was so much passion and love in the show that just made me shiver with excitement the staff in the theater were all very kind and helpful especially with the amount of people in the theater to accompany they did great! we brought a zazu mug and lion king book which didnt come to more than $30.00 so for new york and a theater we think as Brits that it wasn't too bad of a price to pay. Thanks once again LION KING we loved it and would happily watch the show over and over again!	4	5	A M A Z I N G	Deccers19
66	July 14, 2017	This was our first visit to see and broadway show and it didn't disappoint. The three of us wer mesmorized by the performance. You haven't been to the theatre unless you attend a broadway show.	46	5	Excellent performance	Rob G
22	July 17, 2017	My daughter and I purchased prime tickets to see the Broadway production, Lion King. This was a bucket list show she had wanted to see for many, many years. To her it was a dream come true. As we stayed in the theatre district, we walked to the event with excitement. The show started...the costumes, props and back drops were beyond expectations. However the cast did not meet expectations. The vocals were just OK. Our local theatre could have done better. Even the speaking parts lacked volume and enthusiasm for the script. My take-a-way was the cast was line speaking from memory with out gusto and feeling.	7	3	Was it really an off night or is the cast tired with Lion King....	Joan F
83	July 18, 2017	This is a very good place to visit in a lovely, may be cloudy day. Usually busy during the week end. You will enjoy nice views while you walk and will notice that this area of New York has a different flavor. Chelsea Market is nearby where you could do both in the same day. 	18	5	So nice 	MAZIN D
57	June 26, 2017	The Lion King is a very well done show. Nothing will beat the movie version for me, but this was enjoyable. The lady who played Rafiki was wonderful! I really liked Timon and Pumbaa as well. Nala had a really well done solo. We went to the afternoon show, and one problem with that is disruption by younger kids. My 2 kids were with me and they were annoyed as well by the seat kicking, noise and inability of others to sit still. Nevertheless, we had a great time. Worth seeing!	20	4	Fun and well done show	Pookiepoo216
249	July 2, 2017	"Julie Taymor's production of The Lion King was groundbreaking when it first came out years ago, but it continues to hold its charm and exert its magic. I was a little surprised to hear the English-accented voice of the villainous uncle, but it certainly did make him stand out. By the way, everything is so loud that you won't need to get headphones. Music and lyrics by Elton John and Tim Rice respectively along with Julie Taymor's direction and costumes made for a very catchy and polished production. As with the musical ""Cats,"" the actors in their animal costumes/constructions came down the aisles and were up in the balcony as well, to the especial delight of the children at the matinee. I was disappointed in the choreography, though. Having seen Hamilton, I thought that the Lion King would be at least as interesting in terms of movement, but to me it was not. I also thought the movement might be reminiscent of Mexico's Ballet Folklorico, where some of the dancers emulate animals, but it was not. Still, it's one of those things you have to see. As for commemorative tchotchkes, they have a very nice (if pricey) $55 package consisting of a large, soft blanket with that great Lion King graphic, a choice of a big Lion King mug or water bottle, and a good-sized sturdy tote to carry everything in. The blanket is great for wrapping up in when watching TV at home on the couch!"	99	5	Lions and antelopes and birds, oh my!	Glad2BDone
1	July 7, 2017	From the moment Rafiki opens with A Circle of Life, I had goosebumps. There were many brilliant performances but perhaps the most remarkable of them was the performance from Stephen Carlile as Scar. His presence is felt throughout the entire musical. We had mezzanine seats but when we go again we will get orchestra seats to be closer to the performance. 	53	5	A show I'd see for a third time	James M
81	June 12, 2017	This production will not disappoint! The cast, costumes, make up and music were all amazing! There is even something reverent about it that I cannot explain. I highly recommend it for all. It was my 15 yr old son's favorite thing we did in all of NYC, and we saw alot! Sit on the aisle if possible ;)	28	5	Highly recommend!	srampelli
121	June 14, 2017	Highly recommend seeing this play. The staging was VERY creative & colorful. Some of the singers had absolutely amazing voices & left you wanting to hear more. The adult Symba has a very large role and our night the actor was just so so. I was only bored twice through the entire play during two solo ballads. Other then those two insignificant issues it was amazing! Definitely get your tickets in advance, on line because it was sold out on a Thursday night. 	35	5	Colorful & Creative Play	jokt2016
418	June 15, 2017	Located on broadway/times square. Well executed, amazing costumes and special effects... nice story too. To be seen. 	48	4	Beautifully done..!	HA12014
192	June 19, 2017	Lion King is one of show you must see once in your life !! Very well executed, very beautiful, impressive. Even though you know the story, it is impacting and surprisingly. What need to be improved is cafeteria attendance during break time, understand there is no much order during show time. But need to have more people to handle many orders ! Other than this point, I highly recommend.	62	4	Spectacular !!	ftkeji .
49	May 29, 2017	The show is good , one of the best broadway musicals. The music is good, costumes are striking and ticket a tad costly. If U want a broad way experience and willing to splurge 150 per head, go 4 it.... And Indian friends if u have already watched Zangoora in gurgaon, then u will be disappointed with Lion king. 	11	4	Best broadway show	anoop_p999
8	May 30, 2017	First off, I need to point out that I rarely go see a musical that impresses me. Not that I don't find the people talented, It's just not my thing. I enjoy it when I'm there but after I've seen it, I don't really take that feeling away.... That changed with The Lion King, it was absolutely amazing. My fiancee actually started crying because she loved it so much.  I can't recommend this enough and no words will do it justice.	9	5	Best Show I've Ever Seen	MarkDavid24
152	May 31, 2017	Well worth a visit. This show brings the Lion King to life with great acting, choreography and music and singing. Perfect for families. 	175	5	Spectacular	Steve_jersey_86
232	June 3, 2017	When in New York beside the tourist spots, experiencing the broadway show is a must.  It was an enjoyable show with plenty to laugh and played to a full house.  The Minskoff Theatre is a Broadway theatre, located at 1515 Broadway in midtown-Manhattan. It is currently home to the musical The Lion King, based on the Disney animated film of the same name. Lion King has been stage since 2008 and is continuing.	76	5	Truly Enjoyable and Good Experience 	SGNCF
51	May 14, 2017	One word to describe the show 'amazing'.  We got tickets to the sell out show in the front row to which we was not to sure about. Once the show started all was ok and we felt part of the production and we got to see all the little details in the costumes which were so grand. Overall a brilliant show from start to finish. 	13	5	Brilliant Production	Sodi_SIngh
50	May 16, 2017	This was on my bucket list cause I had heard so many great things about it. Seriously. It was off the charts amazing! We decided to splurge and get front row center balcony seats which were totally worth it. The opening song brought me to tears. It was just absolutely breathtaking. The costuming and artistry are just amazing! Not like any other broadway show I have ever seen. Go see it!!! Worth every penny.	13	5	Best show ever!	JL0203
5	May 21, 2017	The show was visually amazing and a huge WOW factor. However, unlike a previous Broadway show that I've seen, I don't really have a desire to see this again. Some of the actors were difficult to understand (Scar and the Hyenas). We were entertained, but I would recommend Wicked over this.	142	4	Visually Amazing	Travis B
25	May 22, 2017	The scenes were not done well, singing subpare we left at intermission as did others, i feel sad as this was the musical we had such high expectations	4	3	Disappointing	Lea K
33	April 27, 2017	Recently saw the lion king on Broadway. The show was a 5 star. The Minskoff theatre was clean and large. They don't serve popcorn and the drink prices are outrageous.... 5$ for a bottled water. The show was pricey but we'll worth it! A must see. 	21	5	The Lion King- a must see!!!	Angel T
23	May 2, 2017	Absolutely outstanding performance!!! Very enjoyable and is worth every penny. I would go see it again!!! No question. Loved it!!!	4	5	Amazing!!!	sulaymcfarlane
53	May 5, 2017	"I'm an out of towner, from smaller city. Basically, I'm cheap - so I have a hard time spending $200 for a show ticket, and have an equally hard time telling someone to spend their $200 for the show. That said - WOW! I have been to other Disney touring productions before, and am always blown away by the quality and attention to detail that Disney provides (I am a ""show"" person myself) - and The Lion King does not come up short. The music and acting is fantastic. The scenery and props are second to none. In true Disney fashion, they completely change the set right before your eyes and you don't even see it until you realize there's now a huge cliff onstage where one didn't exist 2 minutes ago. The the cast is entirely made up of animals, the they way accomplish this is nothing short of outstanding (I especially loved the giraffes, just because the way they pulled it off was so neat). Can I tell you it was worth the money? You will have to decide for yourself, but you will be glad you attended, and leave saying ""WOW!"""	13	5	Wow - just wow.	duncmon
10	May 7, 2017	This was my wife's first time to a broadway and we couldn't have picked a better one. Words can't describe how well done this show is. It's on point with the film and the acting is highly immersive. Brought me right back to my childhood watching this. Costumes were so good! The score was excellent! At the time it's the most expensive ticket on broadway and worth every cent of you can afford to see it. 	2	5	Extravagant Rendition 	William P
154	April 9, 2017	This was the perfect first show for our children (12 and 9) and it is a show that simply cannot be beat. The music, costuming, and staging are perfection. What a wonderful show!	29	5	There is simply nothing better!	ErinnElisabeth
5	April 23, 2017	by the production. usually select seats in center front orchestra but because of nature of production, purchased center nosebleed seats (high up in mezzanine. best place to capture all of the action without head spinning. can't wait to bring by grandkids.	20	5	blown away	Amalya2013
4	April 11, 2017	I had never seen the Lion King Before. My Children Love The Lion Guard on Disney Junior. I was blown away by the customs and how the made these animals come to life. I'm amazed at how the made it look so real. I was into the production as much as my daughter. A must see when you visit New York City.	28	5	An awesome show	FIMGTrustSEO
20	April 16, 2017	This is one of the shows for which you simply cannot find discounted tickets. I had doubt before the show, but now I think it is worth every penny (paid 200 per ticket plus fees). I found myself singing along quite a few times :) a very enjoyable night, hard to believe it is two and half hours	13	5	Worth Every Penny!	CCQQ
43	March 28, 2017	No kidding, how do those actors look and feel like animals. The costuming in this play is to die for. It's unbelievable. Paid full price and sat on the 4th row. It's worth every penny to see these costumes up close. It's very kid friendly and many children were in attendance. My teenage daughter who is an art major was very happy to see the costumes and the sets. Worth the price of admission	14	5	How Do They Do That?	Sheri983
9	March 30, 2017	The show was very good, the production, the animations and performance could not be faulted. My disappointment was that I paid for four orchestra seat tickets at one hundred and sixty dollars each and had a restricted view of the enrtire show. The elevation of the seats is not good and I had to be moving my head from side to side to get a view around others. I did not once get a clear view of the entire stage. The tickets should be sold as restricted view at a cheaper price. Really disappointed!	7	4	Broadway theatre experience - The Lion King	Faye D
69	April 2, 2017	Had wanted to see this for years and it was well worth the wait!! My jaw dropped from the moment it started, absolutely beautiful!!!! Would recommend this for people of all ages!! 	15	5	Amazing!!!!	Johnson_in_Training
22	April 3, 2017	We all have seen the movie a million times, but OMG The Lion King on Broadway is by far one of my favorite experiences ever. The actors, the visuals, the music and the atmosphere were all so great.  I can't recommend it enough! A MUST while you're in NYC. 	2	5	Goooooooo and see the Lion King. 	ljohnso195
63	March 5, 2017	Absolutely mesmerizing. The colors, sounds, illusions. The sets and costumes were out of this world. Sheer genius at all levels. Great for 5 yo to 100 yo!!! A delightful evening.	11	5	Magical	Jane O
60	March 10, 2017	Have seen may Broadway shows and the LION KING is one of my top 3. Great show for all ages. The music, dancing and acting and scenery in this show was top notch. You will be singing along and tapping your feet the entire time, and will leave this show happy.  	18	5	AMAZING	thebrigans
53	March 11, 2017	If you are in New York and have to see a Broadway. This should be definitely first on your list, no questions. The colors, the singing, dancing and characters are a spectacle not to be missed. Recommend buying tickets as early as possible and take the seats in the center on the lower deck, not mezzanine, no matter whatever savings you make.	10	5	Costly but a must do in new york	Prateek A
230	March 11, 2017	This show definitely went above and beyond my expectations. The props and costumes are amazing. The talent of the actors to be able to sing, dance and control those costumes is just fascinating. I would highly recommend. 	59	5	Well worth the money.	QueenB64
28	February 20, 2017	Costumes and music were phenomenal. Orchestra was perfect, drummer was excellent. Old Simba didn't seem great - voice wasn't as solid as others. 	20	4	Very good, a few minor issues.	irish34nd
177	February 21, 2017	Yes I am 52 years old, been to Africa twice, had seen the Lion King in a middle school production and had never seen it on Broadway. WHAT WAS I THINKING.I cried.! It was magnificent. If I saw this show as a young kid I think I would have been in the set design field. It is something everyone should see at least once, possibly twice, three times would be best.... at least.!!!! Dont miss	27	5	First timer	muddyrts
68	February 23, 2017	Seeing the Lion King has been on my bucket list ever since I found out it was on Broadway and it did not disappoint! The colors, the acting, the singing, the setting were all great! Loved the energy of the actors and the way they created the Lion King scenes were very creative. We sat in the balcony in the 2nd row and loved it because we could see everything! However, if you want a close-up view, I'd recommend sitting in the aisles below because the characters come dance through the aisles! The snack and drink options were pretty good and not too badly priced for Broadway. The show itself was a bit pricey but I think it was worth it. If you are making a same-day decision to see the Lion King, I'd recommend going to the TKTS booth in Times Square. They have cheap tickets for same day seating... not sure what kind of seating they offer but I did hear that they save orchestra tickets for celebs that decide they want to go. If they don't show up, the tickets are for whoever!	32	5	Bah! Amazing!	lec3734
27	February 27, 2017	Amazing production! Costumes were pretty cool! More for adults tho! It was long a little too long for young children! 	19	5	NYC	Islandgirl093022
14	February 12, 2017	First time seeing musical in the States. Normally don't like any musical movie so I didn't have high expectation but this Lion King musical was so AMAZING!!!!!! Now I get all the rave about it.  Highly recommend this show. Now I wanna go see more musicals like The Lion King!!	8	5	Amazing!!!!!!	ksh00825
69	February 13, 2017	I started crying from the get go. Everything is just a dream on that show. The singers can't be real, those voices give you goosebumps from the moment they open their mouths. This was a show I have always wanted to see and I finally had a chance and I am so glad I did because it was one of the most amazing musicals I have ever seen.  I knew there was a reason for this show to be running for so many years, and now I know why. The singing and dancing are close to perfection and the stage and everything else is put together so well that for a moment you forget where you are and go back to your childhood. The Lion King is one of my favorite Disney movies and being able to experience the musical was just magical.	34	5	Classic!	Mariana B

17	February 14, 2017	"Went to see the Lion King for my birthday. The singing was unbelievable and the costumes were phenomenal. Although there are people ""playing"" animals, with some of the characters being a person holding an animal ""puppet"" (not sure what the proper terminology is), you easily get lost in the character and do not see the person. I was enchanted from the very beginning with the animal parade up the aisles. Everyone knows the story of the Lion King, but I was eagerly following the play as it unfolded. Get a seat on the aisle if you can, it gives you a great view of the animal costumes as they come up the aisle. If you only go to one play, consider the Lion King. You won't be disappointed."	9	5	Phenomenal	Rita T
296	February 2, 2017	It. Is. BRILLIANT! This show is a work of art. It really is. It’s like the biggest puppet show on earth. How they’ve brought the story to life is simply phenomenal. They’ve even found creative ways to bring the grass and plant life of savannahs of the African plains to life on a stage in New York City. This show deserves every single award that it has won. Every one. Don't second guess yourself - this is a definite must-see. It took me far too long to go see it but that was because the tickets are so expensive (I see why!). My suggestion is that you go to the theatre in time for the afternoon show (2 pm, I think it is) and get last minute tickets for about two-thirds the regular price. That's what I did, totally by accident, since I just happened to wander into Times Square and saw the Lion King sign and decided to try my luck. You may get a seat near the stage but this isn't a bad thing - I was seated in the 3rd row from the stage and I loved it. I saw the brilliant costumes that much clearer and felt even more transported than I suspect I would have felt seated further back or up in the mezzanine. So, again, don't hesitate - this show is totally worth seeing. And bring the kids - they'll love it, too!	117	5	Gooooooo!!!!!!!	Kristine B
65	February 3, 2017	It was the best show in my life! Music fantastic, acting is great, voices are wonderful!!! You should visit this show. I recommend take row after 5.	24	5	The best of the best!!!	Kate T
22	February 6, 2017	Good show, cheapest tickets at $125. Started a little late, and kept letting people in later disturbing our view. At intermission, we aske usher and her supervisor if we could move to one of the last two rows which were empty, because of very tight seats, and children arguing, crying in front of us, but they would not allow us to move. 	11	3	Enjoyed show, started late and allowed people to come in late	CynkwwMboh
264	February 6, 2017	Amazing, I did see three shows if I had to pick just one to see again it would be the Lion King. The cast were great the costumes are just brilliant and oh those so familiar songs. I really enjoyed it even though I had previously seen the Australian production.	112	5	Just loved it.	Mick D
39	August 21, 2016	A great show for my 14 and 17 year old who fell in love with this Disney classic years ago. So nice to see a show that is perfection - costumes done right, beautiful voices, and a venue that is spectacular. I spent a long time on the website trying to find a date with good seats still available. For the price per ticket, I didn't want an obstructed view or to be turning my head to the side for the entire show. Once in the theater, I realized that the venue is really so intimate that there isn't a bad seat in the house. 	38	5	Met expectations	hopkinton
164	August 22, 2016	Although the plot speaks mostly to kids, all that appeals to the sense of sight is for adults as well, because this is just gorgeous!	52	5	Breathtaking costumes and set	Anna P
115	August 24, 2016	I was SO excited to go see this show in Feb. It was colder than anything but totally worth it. The costumes were on point, the character development was awesome and most of all, it paid a really great tribute to the Disney movie without being exactly the same. I loved the way they made it their own. Also, Rafiki, favorite character of the entire show. Absolutely hilarious. The seating was pretty decent too. I didn't see seats that were lacking in visibility. The ticket price is a little steep, depending on where you sit and refreshment prices are typical of Broadway ($$$).	47	5	90's Kid's Dream Come True	seajanetravell
23	August 27, 2016	"Most of us who are interested in ""The Lion King"" know much of the music, and while the music is terrific, the costumes, set design and puppeteers are mind-blowing! It truly is a feast for the eyes as well as the ears! If you're lucky enough to get a center aisle seat on the ground floor, the parade of animals will walk right by you at the beginning of the entry procession and the dancers will enter as well during the beginning of the second half. Truly a not-to-be-missed show while visiting NYC!"	7	5	Visually stimulating!	thegoodsongs
104	August 9, 2016	The show was good, but it wasn't great. Because of the price and the ratings from many past attendees, we expected great. Still, it was a lot of fun!!	20	4	New York conference trip	Janis W
300	August 15, 2016	Got last-minute orchestra seating at Saturday matinee on this mostly sold-out show through Trip Advisor! So glad we booked! The staff does a great job of getting you in and getting you out (especially considering the amount of people). Usually we think musicals are just too darned long, but this ran just right (2.5 hours, including the 15 minute intermission). We already loved the music, but the way they did the set and costumes are amazing. The cast was spot on. This is a total treat, if you see a show...see this one!	137	5	Lucked Out with Matinee Seats	thereKarengoes
23	August 15, 2016	Glad we chose this one, great for all ages. Went with my sister in her 20's and my man in her 70's and it was loved by all three of us. Great acting and vocals and the costumes were brilliant. Very clever. I'd get an aisle seat if I were you...	3	5	Excellent show	Lj G
69	August 16, 2016	seems like it has been running forever-but its still a great play for the entire family to enjoy.......staging never ceases to amaze........often available on a discount ticket basis	20	5	a bit long in the tooth but still worth seeing	Richard W
41	August 18, 2017	It was all incredible ... stage design, costumes, music, acting, and singing. It all struck the note of stunning. And this is a great Broadway musical for children--it is visually engaging and the story is memorable and easy to follow. They even throw in some pretty good jokes. And the Minskoff Theatre is spectacular (after the show you can look out the windows and get some pretty great views of the Times Square area]. Although the tickets are expensive, it is certainly worth a splurge.	22	5	Marvelous and Stunning!	Colin E
1082	September 3, 2017	This original musical transports you to the African savanna. The costumes and music are the best of the show. Great for kids. The theater is big and confortable.	280	5	A must	MTorre
185	September 19, 2017	I always wanted to visit a Broadway show and we were advised to see Lion King. Oh boy we loved it! Great show even for adults and everyone shall see it. The closer the better, but price could be an issues.	25	5	One of the best shows ever	Dmitry S
33	October 3, 2017	This was a lifetime experience for me.i loved it and I carried a happy feeling after watching it. Not to be missed.	11	5	Breathtaking	Greenrosseta
114	October 26, 2017	Nothing like it Try to seat in the middle orchestra Worth every dollar to pay Once in the life time experience You cannot take pictures or videos	20	5	Exceptional	Panda84s
95	November 6, 2017	The story is almost exact to the movie, which I love. The show its self was incredible - I was hooked by the opening scene. The costumes were incredible and the actors did and amazing job. I would definitely recommend checking this out. 	10	5	Incredible 	Stacey M
117	November 16, 2017	I had the opportunity to go to the Lion King at the Nov. 15th performance where all the tickets were free. A lottery was held. This was the first time I went to see the play the pagentry was awesome. Words can not express how thrilled I was. But there will always be a special place for Disney because this gave some parents the opportunity to bring their children and the look of joy on their faces was a sight to see, Kudos.l	27	5	The Lion King on Broadway Fabulous	Harriet M
22	December 7, 2017	What a show! Took my girlfriend to see a broadway show what a good decision.The costumes were really well done and the acting was top very good. Tickets are quite expensive, but it is well worth it.	4	5	New York Show	rosmere1
125	December 25, 2017	Went for an evening show, absolutely incredible performance. Great costumes & stage set up!! A must watch for people of all ages.	18	5	The Lion King	Dale10
53	January 5, 2018	The lion king was sensational from the costumes, singing, comedy to the dancing ... it depicted the lion king story accurately and was amazing. It brings you back to your childhood. Tip try book nearer to the centre of theatre as the sides cut off your view of the entire stage and you definitely don’t want to miss anything! A must see!!! 	16	5	Sensational broadway show	Desi N
36	January 22, 2018	The classic Disney show with a long broadway history still doesn’t disappoint. Ingenious costumes are only matched by very talented actors. Musical score and orchestra are wonderful!!! The show is captivating for all ages as evident by the fact we did not hear any kid outbursts. Look for online discount tickets.	13	5	And the crowd roars	Travelwld
160	February 11, 2018	This was our big splurge for our NYC trip. It was 3 teachers going, so we were on a budget. Our flight was $240pp, our apartment was $280pp and the tickets 6 rows from the stage were $212pp! It was worth the splurge and made memories we will not forget.	78	5	Splurge and get great seats!	RoseTroy3
295	February 21, 2018	The staging and costumes were unbelievable....it really felt like we were in a stampede at one point! All the performers were excellent and the theater was very comfortable. Loved everything about it!!	69	5	Awesome performance	paharlen
76	March 8, 2018	I was blown away by everything. Im a sports minded guy and this was my first Broadway show and I still shake my head when I think about everything that goes into a performance like this. Took our daughter to NYC for her Christmas gift to see the Lion King. Bought our tickets on Stub Hub. Ticket process was a snap. Pickup was very easy. The show its self was amazing. The ushers had you seated in no time. There did not appear to be a bad seat in the house. The actors were amazing. The set and the customs blew me away. Be sure to add this to your bucket list.	25	5	WOW	bateswm
14	March 27, 2018	Absolutely fantastic - I loved every minute and would highly recommend. Great costumes, great performers and had me engaged throughout - fantastic. 	25	5	Gave me goosebumps!!	Castlefor
49	April 15, 2018	This was our first Broadway Show and we were seated in the Mezzanine Row C but had a really good view of the stage. We were treated to a fabulous show with great costumes, puppets and music and we all really enjoyed it. The show was amazing and is a definite must see when in New York.	55	5	Amazing Broadway Show	Adie145
25	April 29, 2018	I knew it would be great, yet The Lion King still managed to exceed my expectations. The consuming is incredible, the music is moving and powerful from beginning to end and the cast coming down the isles from the house to the stage is so moving and powerful. The Lion King is one of my favorite movies so seeing the show was well overdue and I’m glad I experienced it. Bravo!!!!!	5	5	EPIC	SweetBlue007
256	May 9, 2018	I watched the video probably hundreds of times with my kids when they were young so knew the story well. I thought they did a great job of the costumes for the animals, very creative. The sets and costumes were amazing, but the singing was not fantastic in my opinion. And we found that some of the actors, the two lion brothers in particular, did not speak clearly and we had a hard time understanding what they said. The two young people who played the young lions were fantastic. All in all we enjoyed it, we had front row balcony seats which were great, we had a wonderful view of the stage and goings on. I did bring binoculars to see the makeup and costumes in more detail which I would recommend.	102	4	Wonderful costumes and sets	travelling55
14	May 11, 2018	It was really something! Totally different, but in a good way. The music and the story doesnt need any coments, its simply great, and so were the performers. But what really stood out was the costumes, especially for the animals “compars”. Once in a life time experience.	2	5	Best show ever	Barunka Č
217	May 19, 2018	This was such an amazing surprise. The scenes and costumes are so elaborate. Just when u they can’t outdo themselves they do !	79	5	Not Just for Kids	martygood
9	May 26, 2018	I cannot say enough about how fantastic this show is! We sat in the 6th row, and it was perfect! Well worth the price. I don't have a single bad thing to say about it. We even splurged on souvenirs afterwards, we loved it so much. It is definitely not just for kids. If you want to see a memorable broadway show, you cannot go wrong with Lion King. Guaranteed!	10	5	Not just for kids!	narutoshippuden
37	April 16, 2018	I absolutely enjoy the music for this musical. The costume creations were completely amazing! They did the best job making people look like safari animals!! This musical is mesmerizing and hold any theater goer from 5 years old and right on up to 90!! The cast is wonderful. Please take the time to see this production and enjoy it.	10	5	Costumes and Music Wowed!!	Michelle Brando... W
63	April 17, 2018	Most fantastic creative musical. The creativity used is such a wow factor. The high price of the ticket were worth the performance we viewed. The ideas of the costume were out of this world, would love to see this again just for the fantastic atmosphere this musical creates. My favourite character was the baboon whom was also the narrator. Great for all ages! 	17	5	AMAZING GO SEE 	John R
9	April 22, 2018	Wow this was a fantastic show. You don't know where to look on stage.... all the actors were amazing. This is a show you could watch over and over.... definatly want to see this again.... 	41	5	Absolutly Amazing 	_huntj1992
2853	April 24, 2018	The lion king is one of best performances on Broadway. We took the kids and they were on the edges of their sears mesmerized by the animals come to life. The music, the scenery and the story make this show the hit it is. 	695	4	Lion King 	lollygal
152	March 29, 2018	Expensive but really worth it... amazing show and great singing. Make sure you get some good seats...	69	5	Worth it...	Hoffmann5
7	March 30, 2018	This trip was for my disgust era Birthday. She has always loved The Lion King and seeing it on Broadway has been on her bucket list. It was everything she had hoped and we both loved the show. It was amazing. We went to the 8:00 show on a Friday night. We got there about 35 minutes prior and there was a line wrapped around he building, but when the line began to move it went really fast. I recommend getting there sooner if possible if you don’t want to get squished in line. 	3	5	My daughters 21st Birthday 	bernadofam
18	April 2, 2018	If you want to travel to Africa without taking a long flight, then head on over to the Minskoff Theatre to see Disney's, The Lion King. The production crew's collaboration of animal costumes, props, and the manipulation of how the actors were utilized to authenticate how animals move and look were exceptional! Their use of perspective and effects made the animated version come alive. If you could purchase premium seats @ $327.00 pp (sorry premium seats are NEVER discounted, not even for kids or seniors) you will enjoy being immersed with the actors! Show is 2 hours and 30 minutes including intermission. There are two time slots in a day....2 pm and 8 pm. Depending the time you choose, try to eat something before the show. The concession stands don't offer anything major except candy, ice cream, drinks, and souvenirs. After the show is over, just walk right over on seconds to famous Junior's Cheesecake bakery and restaurant! $8 a slice, so we purchased a 6 inch plain Cheesecake so all in our party could have a small portion for $17. Expect to wait on line....Enjoy the adventure!	7	5	Serengheti Wildlife in Times Square 	Miriam C
66	April 5, 2018	An excellent Broadway show. Our seats were great, in the orchestra section, Row R. The staging, props, costumes and music are all excellent. Wonderful performances by all the cast.	23	5	Must See on Broadway	SB9308
159	March 14, 2018	Wow, Amazing. I had chills from the opening number. This play is phenomenal. The costumes, the singing, and the dancing kept us both riveted the entire time. This is a must see, I can not put into words how great this was. I wish I could contact the cast to let them know how much I enjoyed each and every talent on that stage. Don't miss this one, you will not be disappointed!	90	5	World Class..	Scott O
21	March 18, 2018	Awesome show!! I was given tickets for the Lion King as a birthday present, just amazing! The opening scene is breath-taking, the actors, puppeteers and cast members are all fabulous. Would definitely recommend this show!!	5	5	Awesome Show!!	Hezadventures
4	March 23, 2018	Was in NYC for business staying at the Marriott Marquis. Due to a Snow storm I had to stay an additional night so I decided to walk across the street to take in the Lion King. I was truly impressed with the customers, performance and the stage effects. Like many I kept waiting for Tamone and Pumbah... once they came on stage they did not disappoint. The first half was simply brilliant and funny. The second half was more of a love story, so not as entertaining for me. I’d recommend the show. 	11	5	Snowed in... so Broadway it was 	axilator
64	March 27, 2018	There’s a reason why The Lion King has achieved a 20-year run of sell outs on Broadway. The music, costumes, and pageantry delight audiences of all ages every show. It put our family in a good mood for our entire stay in New York. 	40	5	Still the Best	David_Ba928
36	February 26, 2018	I think my expectations for broadway were really high and while the show was really good certain elements let it down. For example of the dancing was out of time and sometimes the diction within the singing wasn't great so if you didn't know the song you couldn't always make out the words. Definitely a good one for children however as the way they do the show is incredible and exciting and the use of the aisles is really effective. I did enjoy it but I thought it would be way above the west end version but it was very similar.	16	4	Good but not perfect	dannagleeson_
3	March 1, 2018	We went to see the lion king in the minskoff theatre in December. It was amazing from start to finish. We had centre balcony seats and had a perfect view of the show. Can’t recommend highly enough this show it was one of the best parts of our trip. If you get the chance to see it you really really really need to go	25	5	Amazing show	killian_tully
330	March 4, 2018	Fantastic show in a great theatre! We had really good seats close to the front. The show was so impressive and comes out into the audience! Great show and acting, we had a great night! 	103	5	My wife’s favourite part of the trip	Adam L
14	March 5, 2018	We saw The Lion King this past weekend. After so many years the music still excites -no surprise there. Yes, the set and costumes are colorful and creative. But, overall the production had a worn out quality. Was particularly disappointed with the slow pacing in the first half and the numerous times soloists could not be heard over the music. Also, the show frequently resorted to slapstick to get a laugh to bring energy to otherwise lacking moments. With the high cost of Broadway shows, I think your money is better spent on a different show. 	3	3	Great music - Average production 	Yale S
170	February 12, 2018	Amazing show! The lion king on Broadway was out of this world. We had such a fab evening. The show was unreal. The costumes, actors, orchestra, singing is all just amazing! I was quite emotional a few times! It was my brother's first time seeing a show and he was a little dubious as to whether he would really appreciate/enjoy it but he also thought it was amazing! So much so he wanted to go see another show!  It is expensive but in our opinion well worth it!   All the staff in the theatre were very friendly and helpful. My mum is deaf so she used the i-caption device and she said it is the best thing she has ever had in terms of access at a show. She explained it was amazing to have something that she could move easily to be looking at the right part of the stage rather than an interpreter who is stationary or captions that again may not be always in the best place. Amazing experience highly recommend to all! 	141	5	Absolutely amazing	Michelle F
76	February 13, 2018	 A must see! The costumes are incredible and the storyline is thought provoking! Best broadway show I’ve seen. Kids love it, and should hold their attention the whole time!	21	5	Amazing show!	kelseymacdonald45
20	February 17, 2018	Fantastic show, great for both young and old. Best thing we did in NYC. The stage appears to be designed to give best views from downstairs, middle seats of rows M to R (not necessarily the most expensive ones).	12	5	Great Show	HillJas
86	February 19, 2018	Extremely talented performers, excellent costumes, wonderful music and choreography. But all that is a given for this venue. For me the story lacks a soul. The humor was flat and practically non-existent, little to no excitement, nothing surprising. It’s hard to criticize such a well done performance, but both my 12 year old and I struggled to stay past the intermission. We did, but ho hum. Tap tap tap. Clap clap clap.	37	4	Great everything except lacks humor and excitement	TiMEtraveler95
20	January 27, 2018	I’m not the biggest fan of shows and musicals, but during our visit to NYC, my wife insisted we saw a show on Broadway and I’m so glad that she talked me in to it. The show was visually stunning and the performances from the cast were fantastic. Tickets aren’t cheap, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone else visiting NYC and looking to see a show on Broadway.	4	5	Visually stunning!	Familyman51
25	January 29, 2018	"The opening of the play was great! Awesome costumes and it makes you feel like you are in the movie and a part of what is going on. If I hadn't seen the movie I could get lost in some of the scenes trying to figure out what was going on (a bit confusing). Kids around me (those under 5) seemed to ask there parents a lot of questions about what was going on. The costumes were great however I was confused why the kid lions didn't have ""masks"" and why the one lion removes his or why they take away the bird puppet from the handler..... just different and confused the kids "	4	3	Meh	kellies863
346	February 3, 2018	Saw this show 21 years ago during the previews and my 8 year old self was in awe and absolutely loved it. Fast forward to my 29th birthday and I went with my husband and it was super nostalgic seeing it again. This is an exceptional show. Absolutely amazing theatrics. Such a great experience both 21 years ago and today!!	152	5	Awesoms	Allison F
72	February 6, 2018	The second Broadway I saw, After alladin. Luckily managed to get tickets during the NYC Broadway week. The Broadway does meet up to all the hype. Amazing set up, costumes, well managed theater, bright and colorful. Fit for all age groups. I got the tickets in H row, which is way up, but gives a good view 	8	4	Amazing 	architamodi1
96	January 5, 2018	I was abit cynical about going to see The Lion King, not being a big fan of the movie. However this production is outstanding and you can only but admire the entire performance, from the props, the lighting, the staging and the singing. The show may have been going for twenty years but it feels remarkable fresh. The scene of the wildebeest stampede was sensational. A special mention for Tshidi Manye who played Rafiki in the performance we saw. Sensational voice.	40	5	Outstanding Production and an an Unforgettable Experience	KiwiTraveler23
4	January 13, 2018	Being a huge Disney fan I was thrilled my husband purchased tickets to see The Lion King. Highly recommend purchasing tickets in advance because it does sell out. We sat beside the aisle and were amazed with all the performers you came down the aisles in beautifully designed costumes. Very entertaining, a definite must see! 	5	5	First time in New York & Broadway	Nadia A
26	January 15, 2018	This show is visually stunning. The costumes are amazing. It is very well put together and was a joy to watch. Definitely something for all ages. Worth the visit.	8	5	Lion King roars	Andre J
81	January 19, 2018	Dont get me wrong, this is a very good production and i enjoyed it. I dont need to tell you about the costumes and everything else every other review will tell you about how wonderful it is.... and its true. I was front row of the mezzanine, the view was great and it was eveything i thought it might and could be. Though at $128 each, im not sure what i am getting more than other family shows like Aladdin(also Disney, $70 in own Box to side) or School of Rock ($39 in site lottery, Row A). All have a big cast and have an impressive visual impact, all were equally enjoyable. I guess the price can be driven by demand and the fact that its been selling out for years... if you are on a strict family budget, i would definately check out the others first, as money doesnt always neccessarily guarantee a 'bigger and better' experience!	91	4	Its very good, though im not sure why its double the price of Aladdin IMHO...	TheWaddy
216	December 28, 2017	Saw the lion king again. It is still the greatest play ever. It’s a must if you have young children. Absolutely amazing. 	79	5	Awesome	Panic1522
28	December 28, 2017	"My mom and I have never been to see the Lion King so made sure to put it on our to do list. We were on the floor, second row right in front of the stage and it was awesome. You could actually hear everyone singing and watch the leader of the orchestra preforming. This was my first Broadway Show to go to and it set a high bar. I am back in the Cocoa Beach/Orlando area now and look for shows near me. I would not say that I recommend like I do most of my other reviews. This show I would say ""you must go and see the show""!"	5	5	WOW is all I can say	Christina H
116	December 31, 2017	Amazing amazing amazing wish I could give 10 stars. Loved it and my son did too. Loved that they came into crowed. Great view from row A on balcony 	16	5	First Broadway 	EricaL264
3	January 4, 2018	Beautiful costumes, music, and story. The sets and lighting really enhanced the show as well. We were on an aisle toward the back of the orchestra section and could see everything well. I would see it again just to take in more details!	1	5	Amazing show	Sheryl749
31	December 9, 2017	I went to see this play while in New York and loved every minute of it!! The singing was Awesome . A must see!	4	5	Great play	rhondat256
45	December 12, 2017	I would highly recommend to anyone, but especially families with small(er) children. We went to the 2 o'clock Saturday show in a snow storm, and had an amazing time. The animals were incredible, the story was engaging and funny and the singing was great.	7	5	Amazing show!	DeninBos
27	December 21, 2017	The whole experience was amazing, this is a show both me and my partner have waited to see for years and it was honestly well worth the wait. Would happily go again, value for money for sure.	6	5	Outstanding!	Joshua h
10	December 22, 2017	Went to see this show with my family and friends. We got good tickets at the Orchestra and we absolutely loved it. Really great show.	1	5	Lion King	Lars K
25	November 19, 2017	This show was mind blowing. The ventriloquism, the design of the costumes, the singing, the authentic African Rafiki made me sit in awe the entire time. This show will never disappoint. 	4	5	A heap of Gloriousness!!!	Erin K
5	November 21, 2017	Great show...great experience. These folks know how to put on an awesome show. They have personnel everywhere to get you to your seats. The costumes were wonderful along with the overall venue. THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR NYC 	2	5	Going to visit NYC? GO TO LION KING!	d2sutton
29	November 28, 2017	I had chance to watch this show both in London and NYc and both shows were great fun. Don't think it is just for kids by the name because everything was so professional and fantastic on stage. You should just go and watch and just have fun !	3	5	Watched in London and NYC and both were great fun !	LeventBulusan
93	December 4, 2017	Perfect show for all the family. We had 3 generations there and we all loved it. The show is a lot funnier than the films and apart from the main story line is totally different and still enjoyable all over again. Seats are reasonably comfortable for the 2 hr 30 min show. Well worth a visit.	42	5	Great Family Fun	MikeP290550
64	November 6, 2017	This is an extremely beautiful show. Beyond the story that must of us already know, this show is visually stunning, and even the simplest things can be overwhelming. Won't say more to avoid spoilers! 	22	5	Awesome	Joel L
70	November 7, 2017	Such a well done production!! Thoroughly enjoyed every moment of what was my favorite Disney movie as a kid. Worth every cent. 	8	5	My favorite broadway play!	Elizabeth J
632	November 8, 2017	Took my grown daughter for her birthday along with and her brother and sister. Great show. One of a kind.	170	5	Birthday present	JohnandJaneS
29	November 12, 2017	My niece had recently graduated high school and wanted to go see this, so I joined her and thought the visuals were amazing! The choreography, the sets, the costumes...they all came together to exquisitely. Aside from that, I do tend to feel that the story telling dragged in just a few places, but overall it was really good and can be an great night the in the city with kids.	6	4	Great Show!	iblt87
3	October 30, 2017	I took my daughter for her 13th birthday. We traveled a long way & spent an extraordinary amount of money for tickets via an app called Headout. Do not use the Headout app. Their site makes it seem as though they're the nicest people on the planet and I'm sure they're trying, but I felt completely robbed by my experience with Headout. I purchased 2 tix weeks in advance and we were in the very last row of the theater. My daughter checked the time at least 5 times, wondering when it would be over. It just isn't worth spending the $ if you're going to be seated in the very back. Very disappointing. The show itself is beautiful (from what I could tell) and the talent on Broadway is incredible. I've been to 5 other shows in years past. This one is probably best for kids 7-11 years old.	1	4	Beautiful show but sitting in the upper mezzanine is NOT worth the ticket price	mimi795
166	October 30, 2017	While I have been to a many Broadway shows they totally rocked this one! By far the best show I have EVER been too!  The costumes are simply unreal. The creativity behind them is mind blowing. The colors, the shapes, it all blended together flawlessly.  I appreciated how closely they followed the story on the movie, it brought my childhood back and added a new level to the show.  The songs were on point, the singers hit each cue perfectly.  We sat at the front of the balcony and felt like we were able to see everything clearly!  This show is celebrating 20 years this year....for a reason....go see it!	35	5	WOW! JUST WOW!	NathanielGoodtimes
363	November 1, 2017	Amazing, and aboslute top of the top. Music decorations, dancers amazing. Simply well know story in amazing show. I was watxhing with opened mouth.! Worth to visit, and it is not strange that they are playing the lion king from 20 years already!	80	5	Top of the top!	Tomek W
10	November 5, 2017	I admit, Lion King is my absolute favorite Disney movie. My kids performed in a Lion King Broadway musical at their middle school last year, so I thought it would be appropriate for The Lion King to be our choice of Broadway play this year. Let me just say we went to see Wicked last year and it was absolutely amazing. I expected the Lion King to live up to the same standards since I paid even more for the tickets. I was extremely disappointed and I hope our Broadway experiences in the future can live up to Wicked standards, unlike the Lion King. Maybe I was ruined by seeing the best play first? Lion King - I didn't like the puppets, some of the dancing was out of sync, the singing was ok... on the other hand, the little boy was cute, funny, and entertaining but that still didn't make up for the rave reviews I read online. I'm going to be completely honest, I enjoyed the same play put on by our middle school earlier this year.. and not because my kids were in it. Some of the middle school cast sang better and performed better than the Broadway cast. Sorry, I must have went to the wrong play but it wasn't worth it in my opinion. It needs to be more modernized. I also didn't like how they kept you over at the end to solicit donations. I was totally ready to go and would've liked them to set up in the lobby at the beginning of the play instead of the end. But the donations were for a good cause and I get it, but simply would've liked to see it handled a different way. 	13	2	Very unexpectedly disappointed 	pn3142
3	October 14, 2017	Super excited for the show had heard so many outstanding reviews. The artistic content to turn people into animals was amazing but the story was a little kitschy and lots of references to other Disney stories. Great for kids but I wouldn't recommend it to adults unless your a big Disney lover!	344	3	Great artist design but definitely for Disney lovers 	Susan M
141	October 15, 2017	I went to see the Lion King with my 13 year old son, who was not sure if he wanted to see a play bc he thought it would be boring. It was the highlight of his trip.  There are a large number of broadway plays to choose from, but there is a reason why the Lion King is a long running hit on broadway (this was my second time seeing this play). It is a classic Disney play. Great costumes, great acting and music.  It is a great play that will appeal to the entire family.  	39	5	A classic 	lorne f
4	October 18, 2017	The Lion King was absolutely breathtaking. The music, costumes and setup were amazing. It is defenitely not just for kids - adults will enjoy it just as much. 	139	5	The best experience in NYC also for adults	Marlene092
76	October 20, 2017	Expensive but worth it.  The show is incredible, even though you know the story the stage production, the acting and the music make it captivating all over again. The seats are comfortable with great leg room, a luxury afforded by modern theatre, and whole experience was one of the best theatre experiences ever. Only disappointment was one member of staff who, when asked a question twice, ignored me. Highly recommend.	24	5	Breathtaking	Sarah E
61	September 21, 2017	We have all seen the film but you cannot beat live theatre and this is one of the best. The venue is really top notch and so easy to get to just off Times Square. The staff are very good and nothing is too much trouble.  The show itself is excellent and you forget at times that there are people under the costumes!! I was wondering how they would execute the stampede scene, but I need not have worried it was brilliant and so well done.  I have been to a Broadway show before but this is one of the best, even if you have no kids you will love this show.....a must see.	58	5	Brilliant Night Out	JLA52
5	September 22, 2017	This Broadway show is located at 45th Street, the Show is fantastic, It is a combination of emotional feelings, it goes from laughing to embracing the most genuine feelings (family, son and father relationship, feeling of belonging).	7	5	Spectacular simply put EXTRAORDINARY	gloria k
50	October 1, 2017	I've watched The Lion King in the West End many years ago, enjoyed it then and so wanted to see the show again during my recent visit to NYC. Well the Broadway production was something else, totally amazing, the atmosphere, the setting, costumes were another level of awesomeness! I couldn't take my eyes off the stage, so much to see, my eyes were watering, I didn't want to blink and miss anything. Our night out was topped off when we accidentally bumped into young Simba leaving the theatre. Tickets were not cheap but worth every penny.	202	5	Amazing!	Carlau
10	September 24, 2017	There is truly nothing like this play - everything else we'd ever seen paled into insignificance - no really! The quality of the performers is so good - their voices are beautiful. The use of the puppets is so unique and done perfectly. And honestly, you can't go wrong with 'Circle of Life', love it.	3	5	GO! See this play!	Fishylaroo
119	September 5, 2017	Wow, simply amazing. Not enough to say how amazing this show is. From the actors, puppeteers and the scenery simply stunning. Some great alternative moments from the movie itself. The opening credits of the circle of life was stunning and it remained stunning throughout. Loved ever second.  Shame the memorabilia is so expensive. 	35	5	Exceptional 	ZLBirchy1979
73	September 10, 2017	Cannot put into words just how amazing this production is, moved me to tears. A complete must see if you are in New York. 	21	5	Phenomenal 	ChesterDart03
48	September 7, 2017	Took my sister to see this show for her 60th birthday. Her first trip to NYC. Such a wonderful show with great talent. Looooved every moment. Third row center tickets even more amazing!!! It was my third time to see but would do AGAIN ...... it is that good. 	27	5	Sooo AWESOME	didi959
114	September 13, 2017	One of the most beautiful shows I've ever seen. Cried from the beginning to the end. Don't worry about getting good seats, you can see well from all seats. I really loved it and really recommend it as something you NEED to see when in NY.	34	5	It's a MUST SEE!!!	Mariane L
82	August 19, 2017	"I bought the tickets for this show months in advance from Ticketmaster. When it was time to print my tickets my printer wasn't working so I requested to be sent by mail. That came in fast. So I put my tickets on the side... and fast forward to the day of the show... while I was about to take the ferry to go to NYC... I realized I left my tickets at home.  I called the Minskoff theatre and they told me they could simply reprint the tickets at the box office. Phew! What a relief! So off we went to the show. Once we arrived there was already a big line. I went to the box office and then I had to go around the block to get in line to go inside. Suggestion: if you need to pick up your tickets at the box office, have somebody in your party stand in line so you would cut the time in half. Anyway, once inside the theatre looked nice, bigger than other theaters I've been. Lots of escalators. Our seat was the very front row on the side of the mezzanine. They told us to put our bags under the chair and not in front of us because a dancer would come in front of us. Wow, exciting!  The row had 5 seats. We were in seat 1-3-5 and a mother with 2 children was in seat 7-9. Yes, a mom with two kids. She held her son (not a baby) and the other son was sitting next to me. I am not sure how she managed to do it. Anyway, the child next to me didn't stop talking (and sometimes kicking) the whole time. Now, I do understand the show is ""the lion king"", but even my child was quiet and followed the show. I understand a child is a child, but let me tell you, these tickets aren't exactly cheap. And I don't expect to go and see this show again any time soon. So please, think about it before you take your child to a broadway show if you are not sure he/she can behave properly.  Having said so, the show was good. A couple of scene were not spectacular (the stampede and the waterfall...) and some were wonderful (the opening and the star/Mufasa conversation). The actors were good. I have to say Nala (adult) was a strong singer. Very nice performance.  After the show you can stop by the gift shop and just enjoy the view of Times Square from the huge windows.  If you are in NYC and you want to see a classic, you have to see ""the Lion King""."	43	4	Nice show	Stone S
3	August 22, 2017	This is not cheap. I want you to read the following opinion before you go.  I'm think that this was wonderful performance when it started. Especially they expressed the animal in a different way which you couldn't see anywhere before. But, now it becomes common and nothing special anymore.  It could be boring if you aren't a big fan of the movie Lion King. My one child and I didn't like this. Moreover, if you come to see this from different time zone, you can fall asleep. FYI, This starts at 8PM and ends at 10:40PM. This must be overrated.	4	3	Overrated	John W
25	August 26, 2017	As with so many things Disney, this show is done completely to the 9's. We sat in the mezzanine, Row CC on the left side of the theater. Performers started the show singing one row in front of us and it continued to WOW us the remainder of the time. The costumes, the stage props, the score all were amazing. I hadn't seen the Lion King movie since my childhood so I had the pleasure of kind of reliving the story all over again. Adult beverages were on the as expected pricy side but like I said it was expected. Highly recommend despite the higher ticket price, worth the $.	19	5	Must See!	StewbieSRT
2	August 27, 2017	What an experience. It was so very well done. It was my first broadway experience. If you have a chance, go! My teenage (17) year old loved it. 	18	5	Amazing!!	Vicki A
21	June 18, 2018	It was epic, the actors, costumes and stage were just amazing, we couldn't take our eyes from the stage. My kid completely loved it and Lion King is her the most favourite thing which we did in NewYork. 	6	5	Kids just love it - Worth the money	Subhalakshmi K
69	May 27, 2018	This was the first of a Disney weekend. The use of the entire theater was unique. I wondered how one turns a 90 minute movie to a 2 and half hour show. The uniqueness of Mustafa's and Scar's falling to their deaths was perfect. I highly recommend it to all.	11	5	A Great Disney Production	macro1958
4	May 28, 2018	Simply amazing!!!! A must see!!! We had tickets on the second row/orchestra and my only complaint is I wish we had sat a little further back.	1	5	Wow!	Caroline R
236	May 31, 2018	The theatre is wonderful. Newer. Very comfortable seats. Plenty of leg room. The show is great. The opening scene alone is wonderful. Well worth the price of admission. No pictures or filming aloud.	98	5	Excellent production	Vincent S
32	June 15, 2018	Great feel good show, music was great, characters played well. Good use of humour. The theatre was cosy and clean. Would recommend.	17	5	Fantastic show	Joanne T
16	June 28, 2018	This is one of 4 Broadway shows we saw in our 10 days in NYC. As a production this one was number 1. The set the costumes were amazing. Obviously growing up with and loving the lion king movie. This was bang on in its delivery. Enjoyed every part of it and would definitely recommend it to others. Like all Broadway shows the cost is up there but you definitely got what you paid for in this instance	5	5	Breathtaking 	Wayne H
303	June 23, 2018	How can I say more about this show than what others already have?! It is incredible - one of the finest we have ever seen.  Minskoff is an excellent venue.  Costumes, voices,orchestra,dancing - all on point!  World class. Don’t miss it!	99	5	Almost didn’t write this	Todd B
179	June 24, 2018	Just fabulous!! Set, costumes, songs.....brings alive Lion King and more. We took my grown up kids for their first time and this show ranked as their favorite of the trip. The performance was outstanding!!	86	5	Awesome!!!	saramarsdenille
219	June 26, 2018	This Broadway extravaganza is so much better than the original movie. The opening is simply spectacular! All throughout there’s great choreography, wonderful music, unbelievable puppetry, absolutely unbelievable costumes & beautiful singing. This production is funny & emotional. Be prepared to be astonished! There’s nothing else like it. Go see Broadway’s version of The Disney movie, The Lion King. It is located 200 W45th St. In the Minskoff Theatre.	30	5	Fantastic!	Jodi H
36	June 27, 2018	Group of 8 ranging in age from 7 to 67. Everyone loved it! Booked through ticket master and had good seats. 	3	5	Fantastic time	DTsNana
121	July 22, 2018	If you haven’t heard anything about this show, the costumes will blow you away. You’d never imagine how creative the costume designers must be to have not only dreamed up these visionary creations, but also made them a reality.  The story is just as you’ve seen in the movie or at Disney so no surprises there. However the narrator in the Broadway show is awesome, in addition to being well dressed. I’d recommend an aisle seat if possible. It’s one of those shows where characters do enter/leave stage in the aisles so you get a close up view when they pass.  The Lion King has been on Broadway now for over 20 years and will delight and entertain the whole family. If you’re a fan of Disney, this performance won’t disappoint!	136	5	Amazing production!	familygalChicagoIL
49	July 9, 2018	Recently on a work trip, I had a free evening to venture out and watch a Broadway show. I knew I wanted to see The Lion King as I have always been a fan of the movie. Being as this was my very first Broadway show, I was not sure what to expect. First and foremost, I only needed a single ticket and was able to get a great deal at the box office the day of the show. This was a Tuesday night so I would not recommend this for a weekend show. I arrived 15 minutes before show time and had no problem getting in the door and to my seat in time (again, this is on a weeknight although there was not an empty seat in the place). The show lasts 3 hours in total and has one 15 minute intermission. It was not hard at all to stay focused for the entire time. You are required to shut off your phone during the show so the only pictures I have are added below. The theater itself was beautiful. The staff was friendly and helpful.  The show was seriously incredible! The intro gave me chill bumps and literally brought tears to my eyes as I was in pure awe. The performers, their costumes, the vocals and the music (which was all live) blew me away! The show stuck to the movie pretty well and the man who played Mufasa was by far the most perfect match for his character.  I highly highly recommend this to anyone who has the time while in NY. I would watch it 5 more times if I had the opportunity.  Awesome job to the performers who make you feel like it is the show of a lifetime, every time!	9	5	Incredible! Stunning! Gave me chills!	Marinesis2005
76	July 12, 2018	As expected, it was amazing. I love the songs from The Lion King and the singers were world-class. Particularly loved the singing from Mufasa and Rafiki. A very grand production in a big theatre. And of course, tickets were very expensive, but have always wanted to experience this on Broadway.	16	5	Who doesn't like The Lion King?!	ccstwb
542	July 17, 2018	My wife has wanted me to take her to see the Lion King for years, but it never has played where we've lived at the time. So when we had the opportunity to see it prior to boarding a cruise ship we went for it. This show is spectacular and moving. We went on a photo safari last year and so the Lion King actually meant a lot more to us now. The visuals are spectacular and the music is wonderful. If you go on Wednesday afternoon's show, know that the audience will be made up of many excited and noisy children. Great facility too.	138	5	Amazing Performance	Edmundo_de_ABQ
51	July 21, 2018	A spectacular show that the whole family enjoyed! My kids (12 and 9) were so thrilled, they enjoyed it more than the Disney movie! Strongly recommended!	7	5	Simply amazing	Chryssis
