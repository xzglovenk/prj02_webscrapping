23	June 19, 2018	This show moved me to tears multiple times. The actors were amazing and really poured their hearts into the show. No matter what seats you have, it is quite easy to see the stage. The merch store was great too, although it was expensive. This is my favorite show on Broadway, and I hope to be able to see it again someday!	37	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Arguably the Best Show on Broadway	Larangie F
204	November 27, 2016	What an amazing Broadway Show the story the strong performance by the cast . The lead Ben Platt was amazing stone voice The great thing about the story is how this is so relatable in people's lives The musical just rocks next year's Tony Award	38	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Phenomenal Broadway Musical	1210tgho
127	December 13, 2016	This show is a must see while in NYC. It was a show with deep emotions, that will follow you through the coming days. I don't think one person in the theater was emotionless during key points, which is SO hard to accomplish. The music is beautiful, and the show is well written. Ben Platt is one talented actor/singer. Go see it - This musical is certainly worthy of the buzz. #youwillbefound	44	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Run to see this show	melissa1233
1	January 10, 2017	"In 2009, Broadway was forever changed by a completely original musical focusing on mental health. Next to Normal went on to win Tony awards, a Pulitzer Prize, recouped its investment and paved the way for shows like Fun Home and Dear Evan Hansen to be commercial successes on Broadway. When I first heard about Dear Evan Hansen and its similarities to the aforementioned show, I was sure I'd be a huge fan. However, it lacks in comparison in almost every aspect.  To focus on the positive, Ben Platt as Evan Hansen is giving an extraordinary performance for such a young man. Rachel Bay Jones is also strong as his mother. There are a few moments when all the components in the show work together to create strong theatrical magic. But these are few and far between and not worth the ever increasing price of Dear Evan Hansen tickets. The score is largely basic and unmemorable (with ""Waving Through a Window"" being the major exception). The composers did stronger work with their off-Broadway musical Dogfight from a few years back. The set design becomes irritating over time. There is little to comment on in regards to costumes or choreography. But my major problems with this show lie with its plot and characters. The only character I felt even slightly endeared to was Evan Hansen himself and even he became irritating at times. Every other character was either a stock stereotype, completely unlikable or both at the same time. When you're dealing with such emotional subject matter, you want to be able to feel for the characters, but that's impossible when they're so thinly drawn. The plot is unrealistic. Watching someone get stuck in a lie is one thing but watching the only likeable character get stuck in lie after lie after lie after lie is frustrating. It's also completely predictable. The audience knows at some point he will come clean, taking away any element of dramatic tension. Once the confession has been made, the show is at its best. Unfortunately, by that point there is not much of the show left. The show deals with subject matters such as social anxiety and suicide yet is mostly lighthearted and overly comical until the final section. Whilst the show may be about teenagers, I felt there was little need to make such a serious show so adolescent. I found it difficult to understand why Next to Normal was unafraid to go deep and dark back in 2009, when the kind of show it is was unprecedented, but Dear Evan Hansen is terrified to in 2016 when shows like Next to Normal and Fun Home have paved the way for it. I admire an original musical, I admire difficult subject matter and I admire the efforts of the cast to elevate the material. But ultimately this is just average and the emotion it attempts to convey will likely not be reached by anyone that knows great storytelling. I'm sure a lot will be said about how innovative this show is, but the truth is, it has been done before and to a much higher quality. The true innovative show of the season is Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812. And trust me when I say, neither is the next Hamilton. Shows like Hamilton come along once every twenty years, not once every year."	5	3	Dear Evan Hansen	Poor man's Next to Normal	Aleeigh
104	February 6, 2017	Ben Platt made this show by his excellent singing and nuanced acting. I liked it a lot both the book and the score. However, it will make you cry and if you've lost someone recently it will be pretty intense. Not unbearable, but be forewarned about the crying. Good view from the balcony center.  The set was underwhelming, but that's my only criticism. 	79	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Great show, especially. Ben Platt's singing	Rob H
20	March 7, 2017	Ben Platt leads this amazing musical that explores anxiety, honesty, and how the modern social media landscape can amplify the beauty as well as the complexities of life. This musical was so touching and made me feel all the feels. I laughed, cried and left so hopeful and happy.  This musical achieves everything a theater experience is meant to.	9	5	Dear Evan Hansen	SIMPLY AMAZING	Cy M
14	April 9, 2017	Went to the show to see Ben Platt. Inside the Playbill it said that the understudy would be playing Evan Hansen in the performance about about to begin. Contacted the manager and he said I could not exchange my tickets for another performance. Stayed about 15 minutes, and walked out in disgust. It should be advertised in the front of the theatre when the lead in a show won't be in it, and the theatre goers should be offered options to exchange ticket, or for a refund!	81	1	Dear Evan Hansen	Star Missing	amefromnyc
928	May 8, 2017	This is not your typical feel good musical. It has a strong message about alienation-- not just of teens but also of adults and parents. Ben Platt has gotten lots of attention, but I was especially impressed with Michael Lee Brown as Jared who actually was standing in for the regular Jared.  Only thing I did not enjoy was the tiny leg room in this old theater.	1046	5	Dear Evan Hansen	A musical with a message	Torte_Sue
221	June 9, 2017	People don't want to talk much about the plot of this musical, because they don't want to give away the surprises. Don't let that reticence fool you: the story grabs your attention. And the performances--and the VOICES--are richly beautiful. How far would you go to escape your loneliness? DEH explores that question, and that exploration will move you.	85	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Everything You've Heard Is True	Andrew W
411	July 14, 2017	My daughter chose this one and it was truly excellent. Ben Platt is amazing. The subject matter is dark and not suitable for younger kids. We loved it and I have to admit that it made me cry. I highly recommend it for teens and adults.	268	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Excellent	misanthropicdreamer
41	August 7, 2017	I love fun musicals that make you feel good while you're watching them and afterwards (like Kinky Boots and Something Rotten). I also love more dramatic musicals that aren't a laugh a minute but have great scores and songs that you are singing long after seeing the show (like Les Miserables and Phantom). Dear Evan Hansen is something new entirely. It is dramatic, heart wrenching, deep, exquisitely acted, moving, and thought provoking. This is not a musical where the action stops so they can pop in a catchy song. The songs blend seamlessly into the storyline and dialogue and enhance the drama rather than detracting from it. I'll be stunned if Ben Platt doesn't go on to have an incredible career both in musical theater and film. His acting is superb (reminiscent of Dustin Hoffman in Rainman or Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump). The rest of the cast is terrific as well. This is a show that everyone, especially teens, should see (not appropriate for children though because it deals with very heavy issues such as suicide) to make them think a little more about what others might be going through in life that isn't always apparent on the surface. Bring tissues---lots of them!	20	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Outstanding!	LilyVonSchtupp
23	September 4, 2017	Saw Ben Platt's mesmerizing performance at the Tony awards, and with an upcoming NY trip planned wanted to see the show. Quickly learned it was sold out for months. Figured I would try the cancelation line and lottery. Fortunately the few days there Ben Pratt was ill (ok, maybe not fortunate for him), so that increased a cancellation possibility. Got a ticket.  I can see the appeal for teens, their angst, insecurities, ravaged self-esteem, and soul-searching, as well as for the parents forced to suffer through such travails.  End of first Act is a tear-jerker. The entire family in front balling, many sobs all around when the lights went up.  Second Act was not as emotional. I won't drone on as billions of reviews here. Wasn't the life-changing experience some apparently have, but was entertaining. Lots of fun numbers to see.  The guy who played the lead in Ben's place did well, though I personally wondered if he was too good-looking and had too pretty of a voice for that role. Just one person's opinion.  Not a must see, but a fun evening.  The end of Act 1 is a tear-jerker. The family in front was balling.	24	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Entertaining show.	Grumbly
33	September 25, 2017	The best broadway show I've ever seen. Ben Platt is otherworldly. The show will still be amazing without him, because that's how good the show is, but he's beyond sensational.	10	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Amazing	lansing526
810	November 29, 2017	Dear Evan Hansen is a coming of age play, but it goes so beyond that. It covers the parents, friends, school, social media, suicide, depression, and confusion of growing up. It will make you cry, laugh, cry and cry again. The actors are phenomenal, we did not see the original Evan, but ours was amazing. So there is nothing lost in the story. I highly recommend getting tickets if you can. An excellent play. Bring tissues Note: Absolutely NO late seating. To the start and after intermission	254	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Wowser!!! One of the BEST for 2017	NickellFamilyTravel
24	December 28, 2017	I found this musical incredibly modern and dealing with the life of teenagers nowadays and the social media. Great acting extremely emotional 	13	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Emotional story extremely up today 	Marta C
1573	January 28, 2018	"There's a reason this show is a hit with audiences and critics--it's superb, surprising, and stirring. It's the kind of show where you keep thinking about it and talking about it weeks after seeing it--about the plot and the social issues it raises, about the staging and storytelling, about the performances. The story has sad roots, but the show is not dark or depressing; rather, it's quite uplifting by the end. It's portrayal of struggle is real--and not just for the main character, but for all of the parents and peers in his orbit. The music is deeply memorable--these are some melodies you'll sing for some time to come. There's a real emotional power to the lyrics and the songwriting. The staging is minimal and very impressive; the visual imagery very effectively reinforces the musical's social media storyline while the simple sets effectively convey the various environments in which the plot advances. And the performances. Wow. Yes, the main character is the star--he must be so drained by the end of every performance, given the sheer emotional output and the deep physicality of the acting. The anxiety from which he suffers is portrayed in how he sings and right through how he uses his hands, arms, feet, etc.; it's an all-encompassing performance. But what makes this such a strong show is the strength of the ensemble--each character means something and the performances of the other cast members are up to the strength of the main character. The mother's performance is particularly strong. A ""must-see"" show--buy your tickets WAY in advance to secure availability at the best prices. We were thrilled we saw this and continue to listen to the soundtrack and talk with friends about the experience. Musical theater at its best--performances with something to say, and actors at the height of their abilities. Wow."	710	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Very Moving and Memorable	brmusicman
26	March 7, 2018	I had no idea what to expect as I had never heard of this musical before, but I was pleasantly surprised. This show had such a powerful message. So many of the audience members were in tears by the end of the show. It was completely sold out. We had amazing seats in the front row of the balcony. We could see everything wonderfully. Cast was partially the originsl cast which made it eben more special. I would definitely suggest this musical. 	11	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Wonderful show	windycitygirl2014
93	March 9, 2018	This show turns a tragedy into joy. The cast is superb and the music enchanting. You will laugh and you will cry. In the end, you will feel nothing but love. It's beautiful.	21	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Incredible Show	MaryEhret
15	March 12, 2018	Our favorite show on Broadway (and we've seen most of them). Was fortunate to see the original broadway cast, but I've heard the replacement for Evan is just as spectacular as Ben Platt. I was not expecting to have such an emotional response to the story, but it's just too perfect and too real for today's youth. Incredibly talented cast. You will laugh and cry. So good. If you can get tickets to this one, don't pass it up!	2	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Amazing & Powerful	Jackie M
186	March 14, 2018	We have seen so many musicals in NYC. Dear Evan Hansen was one of our all time faves. So much talent on the stage with such a meaningful message on many fronts. This is a great show to take your teenagers, young adults or anyone. Theme may be a little mature for young children. Go and see!	56	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Amazing and Touching Show	CathyCole
84	March 14, 2018	Ok I'll admit it, I just didn't love this show! I think I may be alone in this camp but I just found it too formulaic. Admittedly, the first act is very good but it goes down hill in the second. It all conveniently wraps up just a bit too tidily in my opinion.	26	3	Dear Evan Hansen	What's wrong with me?	DBronchick
6	March 15, 2018	According to all the reviews this was a sure thing ... hmmm. Granted a few scenes were poignant I didn’t find all the numbers consistently flowed together. Evan lead was great but some parts of the show kind of lagged. One of the opening lines about a character also elicited a negative audience reaction considering today’s headlines re high schools. I’m sorry — this was supposed to be the highlight of our stay but while I left having enjoyed the show I wasn’t as overwhelmed or touched as some other audience members were. 	5	4	Dear Evan Hansen	I know I’m supposed to love it ...	samiamtravel
449	March 18, 2018	If you've seen a lot of broadway plays, I suspect this one, as with us, will not make it into your top 5 or so. While very good it just doesn't make it as one of the greats. While all the performers/actors were excellent the subject matter, songs, acts while very good just miss the excellent mark. Sometimes it was hard to hear the soft spoken dialog of Zoe. The subject matter of the play is outlined in many reviews and at times leaves you wanting to shake Evan back to his senses as his web of continuing growing lies is frustrating. Certainly a very good play with excellent performers and worth the price.Seats are tight at the music box theatre.	132	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Very Good But Not One of Our All Time Favorites	ivytravel
68	March 18, 2018	This was the show my 16 year old son wanted to see after being inspired by his theatre teacher last year. The main character really resonated with him. I'm so glad we saw it together! Absolutely beautiful performances and a moving story - do not miss it!	26	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Excellent!	abibh
267	March 25, 2018	Girls weekend. A friend got tickets. I had not even heard of this production.  OMG - so timely for today’s kids. And parents.  Who knew just a few cast members could make a production so fulfilling. The songs, the voices, the backdrop - I lost myself in this play. I cried, I laughed, I nodded my head often. I cannot wait to see it again. 	118	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Moving, relevant, and amazing!	SunshineWonderland
217	March 26, 2018	This show is outstanding with a great cast. The script is current with respect to suicide and the loneliness in high school and is challenging in the subject matter. This is not a feel good musical but is worth while seeing.	123	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Fantastic Acting and Script	Mike H
32	February 4, 2018	I recently went to Dear Evan Hansen (DEH) with NO expectations at all. I heard non-stop raves about the show and its stars, but knew nothing about what the show is actually about. Having now see it twice (through regular tix and winning lottery tix), DEH is one of those shows you see and then can't stop thinking about. The acting is mind-blowing. Noah Galvin, currently playing the Evan Hansen character, is so terrific in this role that I am absolutely certain that he would have won the Tony award had he been playing the role with the show first launched (with all due respect to Ben Platt, the original Evan Hansen). Noah's performance is gripping - he portrays an anxiety-ridden teenager so perfectly and emotionally - it's heartbreaking and gut-wrenching to watch. Not for one second do you NOT think he's nervous, has sweaty palms or nervous tics. And his ability to cry during the show is the icing on the cake. Noah's performance is unlike anything I've seen on Broadway. Sadly, he leaves the show on February 4th - the producers would be wise to bring him back to the show when his replacement leaves.  The rest of the cast is also top notch and it's a great ensemble performance. And the now Grammy Award winning cast album is music you will be listening to for a long time to come and, each time you listen, you'll remember this gripping show and it's message that everyone matters and you will be found.  Taylor Trensch is taking over the Even Hansen role starting on February 6th. He has very big, enormous, giant, huge shoes to fill and let's wish him all the best. I just don't know of a performance that could possibly be better than Mr. Galvin's. Let's wait and see... GO SEE THIS SHOW. Tickets can be tricky, so be sure to plan ahead. Enjoy.	19	5	Dear Evan Hansen	This show needs to be at the top of everyone's list.......	Kaongs
11	February 12, 2018	I am an avid broadway purveyor and have watched dozens of broadway shows. Dear Evan Hansen stands out amongst the best of them - a great story and so vital in the world of social media, and looking to stand out and finding out who you are (and having the courage to be true to it). Highly recommend to everyone, especially those with teens and pre-teens too.	23	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Amazing musical, great acting and script	LonghornTraveler13
5	February 19, 2018	This is a MUST SEE production. This was my first broadway show, I was blown away! Being a newbie, I almost walked out at intermission thinking it was done lol. 	11	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Must see	missmm31
6	February 20, 2018	Great music, good character development & most importantly doesn’t put you to sleep with slow dreary music. Would certainly recommend to those that don’t enjoy musicals and are dragged along as a +1 with the wife 	5	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Excellent ... and I hate theatre shows	rhett2344
56	February 23, 2018	We got tickets for a February show back in October. We sat second row balcony to the right and the seats were great. That said there doesn’t seem to be a bad seat in the house. As far as the play...just see it, no matter who plays Evan, just see it. You won’t regret it...it lives up to the hype. Adults, young teens would definitely enjoy. A 13 year old was in our group and they really enjoyed it. If I could give it more stars, I would.	14	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Just go...you won’t regret it	ellalivi04
27	February 25, 2018	This show. I brought my teenage daughter to the show and she loved it. My daughter hasn't smiled in months, but she knew the songs. The characters are so real. As a mom of two teens, well bring the tissues. The performances are gut-wrenching and real. Life is so complicated these days. Where is the moral compass, who's judging who, and who's to say your decisions won't have reprucussions. We are listening kids, but sometimes you have to get in our face so we remember to get off our devices. The music is beautiful and the cast wonderful. Really touched. Very important for teens to go see this show. 	11	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Run, Don't Walk	Candi M
10	February 26, 2018	I saw DEH show on the weekend - it was a very moving show, excellently executed, absolutely incredible music - can't get it out of my head all weekend!  I wouldn't say it was my fav show ever, as most people are saying, but there is a reason why it's won so many Tony's. The subject matter is relevant, the story interesting, the music incredible, and it is a topic that I feel every parent and their teenager should discuss - the disconnect between parents and kids and how that can play out. It's incredibly moving and an important show. I'm so grateful I got to see it.  Now - Ben Platt is no longer headlining it, but the new lead is absolutely astounding. so just go... it's a must see! Tip on Getting tickets last minute: prices dropped the day before - I got mine off Vivid Tickets - able to get 2 tickets orchestra level for 185$ each, as opposed to $350 a few days prior.	3	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Creative show, Moving, every parent and their teenager should see this show!	Jessica S
14	February 25, 2018	We already had tickets to Hamilton; yet I was compelled to see this show as well because we were told it was “life-changing”, “amazing” and friends and family played the music nonstop. So I splurged and bought tickets to a second show in as many days - and it turns out what we heard was true. Dear Evan Hansen is profoundly touching. Its messages of wanting to be seen and liked for who you are and that you are not alone, as well as its non-sugar-coated portraits of family dynamics, of grief, as well as the struggles of too many teenage youth are spot on & very timely! The acting and music are as evocative as the messages - and both my 16 year old daughter (who initially didn’t think she’d like the play) and I were deeply moved. The actors are all so talented and have beautiful voices! The sets are sparse yet creative and the last one is breathtaking! If you are wondering- the new Evan Hansen is stellar! Amazing voice and acting. I wouldn’t recommend this play for young children (I think there is an age limit), as it deals with suicide, but for all others it is a must see! We had the extra thrill of getting the lead’s signature - stay after the performance to the front left of the theatre (as u r looking at it) - there may be a roped off area- and see who comes out. #youarenotalone #youwillbefound and u will love this show! 	13	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Incredibly moving, profound message, & beautifully performed! 	LuxeTravelLisa
169	March 4, 2018	I knew that the story was powerful but I was unprepared for just how much. Absolutely hits you hard and you can’t help become emotional as the story unfolds.  Incredible acting, bringing you into the story which such a connection that you can’t help but be overcome with tears by the end.  A must see and such an important message to send.	81	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Emotional, be prepared to cry	jenandcody
29	January 5, 2018	My daughter and I saw this show in January. We bought our tickets months in advance as it was hard to get tickets to this show. It was worth the wait. The show was great from the very first act. We loved it and would definitely see it again. 	3	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Wonderful Show	CSILPD
272	January 9, 2018	I wasn't real excited going to this show because I thought it was a dark topic (suicide) that I have dealt with too much in life (once is too many times). It didn't dwell on the suicide. It dwelt on the social issues surrounding Evan Hansen and how he ended up in the position he was. I wouldn't take real young kids, but this show wouldn't be bad for high school aged and older. I still think about some of the issues and questions that it raised and I saw the show about 2 weeks ago.	59	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Great subject matter, makes you think beyond just the night of the show	CRPD908
84	December 30, 2017	We saw 3 plays on our last trip to NYC and my wife and I both can agree this was our least favorite. It was a good story but nothing like a Hamilton, Phantom or Lion King. I had to pay a premium for these tickets...not worth it.	37	3	Dear Evan Hansen	It was just ok...	JSSBeenThereDoneThat
18	January 11, 2018	Seeing DEH at the Music Box was the highlight of my visit to NYC. The entire cast was phenomenal. Noah Galvin has developed Evan Hansen into his own character and was full of enthusiasm. After seeing video clips of Ben Platt prior to his departure, I was just as impressed. The story is an emotional one but the sadness is balanced by humor and optimism. It is especially relevant in today's society where so many of us are connected to our mobile devices and social networking. I waited outside by the stage exit and was able to meet Noah Galvin and get my Playbill signed. Despite the near record cold and wind, he was smiling and even posed for photos. Bravo to all involved in the production of DEH!	24	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Powerful and relevant	Brandon W
97	January 20, 2018	Visiting my bestie in New York, she spoiled my son and I with tickets, which was on our wish list but sold out , so was such a surprise! And it didn’t disappoint, I laughed, sang, cried...I’m such a tragic but that’s how amazing it was. My son bought the cd on the way out and had it down word for word in 3 days! An absolute must see ❤️❤️	33	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Just so amazing....loved the music..could watch 100 times over..	Janine K
12	January 21, 2018	LOVED LOVED LOVED this play. Excellent actors/actresses. Great songs. Although bullying and suicide is part of the story, it is not all gloom, doom and disaster. Great message. Very entertaining. Would definitely recommend seeing it.	2	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Broadway show	antoinettegentile
47	January 24, 2018	I saw DEH twice, both with Ben Platt. I'm sure the current star is good, but Ben Platt has to be the best actor/singer I've ever seen. No one compares to him. The show is amazing with an incredible score and a deeply moving plot. You will memorize every song and find yourself listening to the soundtrack on replay again and again.	14	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Wish I could see it over and over again	gzwmom2015
51	January 26, 2018	I fell in love with DEH a year ago when I first heard the Broadway cast album. Even without knowing the story behind the musical the music moved me to tears. Anyway, I finally saw Tony winner for best musical, DEH, in January, 2018, and it blew me away! The set design is dominated by moving panels displaying constantly changing internet images with pieces of furniture moving on and off the stage as needed. The story of a socially awkward, insecure teenager trying to find himself, along with the beautiful music and outstanding acting of the entire cast was incredibly moving. In the lead role I got to see Noah Galvin who replaced Tony winner Ben Platt. Galvin delivered an exceptional performance in what is considered to be one of the most demanding musical roles to sing and act. Great show! Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!	29	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Sincerely Awesome!	Schreckster
7	January 27, 2018	Anniversary trip to New York with only one purpose, to eat well and be connected to Broadway. I had been listening to Hamilton for the last few months to be ready in case we were able to score a pair of reasonably priced seats, so I had no expectations when my wife suggested we see DEH. Having heard about the story, I started listening to the soundtrack in advance to get a better handle on the show. Even after listening, I wasn't sold as I told my wife that after listening to Hamilton where the entire show is in the music, I was struggling to fill in the gaps between songs even as good as they were. Now, there was nothing easy about securing these seats, and we paid premium for them, but the show did not disappoint. Noah's gut wrenching performance as a teenager lost in the world, trying desperately to belong was excellent. Ben Platt obviously excelled in the role with all the accolades he received, but Noah drove the show this night. By the end, I don't believe there was a dry eye in the house as Mom's and Dad's and kids alike found a moment or moments that touched home in some way. All you ended up wanting was a hug from your family, and the chance to get to tell each of them that you loved them for who they are, nothing more.. nothing less. If in New York, check it out. You will not be disappointed.	7	5	Dear Evan Hansen	No Expectations	Blake V
157	November 29, 2017	This was a well written story, beautifully done in the theater. The music, cast, and all about it was top notch. Not an easy ticket to get but worth it if you can. We saw the play last week with the lead that does the show for matinee's. So it wasn't the original guy that left just last week, nor the new one taking over, but regardless excellent. So go and enjoy it.	43	5	Dear Evan Hansen	It Lived Up To the Hype	thomaseX967TZ
75	December 4, 2017	Loved this show! I was worried it would be depressing based on reviews. And yes, I cried. But I also laughed. The cast is terrific including the new Evan Hansen - Noah - who is there through part of January. The music is compelling and enjoyable. Usually, I know a soundtrack inside/out before I go but we went to this one on a whim and I did not know any of the music. And I still loved the music immediately. Highly recommend this! My 13 yr old was with me and she really loved it too. Very relatable topics for teenagers.	34	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Took my 13 yr old daughter - Great show!	travelkat2570
626	December 4, 2017	We planned a trip to NYC to see Dear Evan Hansen before Ben left the show and we weren't disappointed! We sat in right mezzanine, row D 18 - 20 and had a great view! Seats were tight, but not too uncomfortable. A must see when in NYC!	115	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Incredible!	WBJM2009
404	December 5, 2017	Love love loved this musical! I have been listening to the music for months and was very excited to go! Unfortunately we found out the night of the show that Rachel Bay Jones would not be performing. Her understudy was fine, but just not the same. It is just a great story in general though - highly recommend.	134	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Ben Platt was amazing, disappointed not to see Rachel Bay Jones.	Brenna R
15	December 14, 2017	We went on a last minute whim to see Ben Platt the weekend he left and paid a small fortune but it was well worth it. One of us was reluctant but became an instant fan! It’s such a wonderful show - you feel so anxious for Evan at some points and the first act is better than the second - but go! 	5	5	Dear Evan Hansen	I think you will LOVE it!	thepreppygrl
25	December 18, 2017	Was on the fence about splurging a little on this show not knowing how much my husband would love it- so glad we made the executive decision to go! Waited until approx one hour before the show and bought tickets through stubhub as we came up short through tkts and at the box office. Can’t stop listening to the music since. Be prepared for a few....lots of? tears! 	12	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Pay the money- feel the feels	jackieluke
61	December 21, 2017	I cannot say how much I love Dear Evan Hansen. I really connected to the soundtrack and have been dying to see the show on Broadway, but was unable to get tickets the last time I was in NYC. All I was able to do was wave through the window. This trip, I somehow got a fabulous last minute ticket and it was worth every. single. penny. This cast is simply incredible. This production really earned those Tony awards!! It must be incredibly daunting to try to fill Ben Platt's shoes, but I thought Noah Galvin did a great job! Three of the actors came out of the stage door after the show and signed my playbill, which was amazing. Go see this show!!	15	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Words fail	Allison B
3	December 21, 2017	An absolute must if you love the theater. My. Recent trip to NYC was planned around seeing this production before Ben platt’s departure. I had third row center and I remain awestruck. You will laugh, cry and be touched by what The Arts can accomplish.	61	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Thank you Evan Hansen!	John R
25	December 26, 2017	I saw this for the second time last week in NYC I was very fortunate to see it with the original cast the first time. The replacement for Evan isn't as talented as Ben Platt but still did an amazing performance. The music and talent were five star. This isn't a show for really young kids since it deals with teen suicide.	208	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Best musical I've ever been to	404man
338	October 1, 2017	Be ready to feel every emotion...this brilliant production takes you on a wild ride. Laughter...tears...hope...despair. We got out tickets seven months ago...and the wait was definitely worth it. Stellar cast. The sets and lighting are very innovative. The power of the voices reaches into your soul and squeezes tight. Do whatever it takes to experience this masterpiece.	86	5	Dear Evan Hansen	POWERFUL!!!	Michael A
299	October 13, 2017	Ben Platt is just simply amazing! The musical will certainly move you. Very emotional with a lot of energy- I don’t see how they do it nightly. The tickets were way too expensive, but I’m so glad we went. All of the performers were great. If you can do it, put Dear Evan Hanson on your list.	48	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Just about as Good as I have ever seen	WineSnob7
45	October 22, 2017	What an amazing show. It's an emotional roller coaster, I was laughing one minute and sobbing uncontrollably the next. Didn't get to see Ben Platt but Michael Lee Brown was excellent. The whole cast overall was exceptional. Highly recommend this show to parents and their teens. I went with my 14 year old daughter and I'm so glad we shared this experience. What an incredible show. 	19	5	Dear Evan Hansen	WOW	Mollaroo
1531	October 26, 2017	What an amazing play with a very powerful message! The actors were all superb—and Evan was played by the understudy! I could have turned around and seen this play again! I liked having the music come from above instead of below! I recommend this for teens and adults.	403	5	Dear Evan Hansen	One of Favorites Ever!	annarc6
272	October 29, 2017	Saw the matinee expecting BP but got Michael Lee Brown as Evan. The work stands on its' own. Spectacular effort and emotion in making this world real and heart-wrenching. If you like your Bway with substance, make a date - no matter who is starring.	72	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Understudy Doesn't Matter	BobPhibbs
774	October 29, 2017	Had trouble deciding whether to buy tickets to this show considering the subject matter, especially since it was presented as a musical. No two and a half hour show can adequately delve into the lives of two young men suffering from disorders and mental illness. The majority of the reviewers and people we spoke to think this was a show about anxious, unpopular and lonely high school students. Sadly that is not the case at all. Evan Hansen's father was painted as a cad who left his family, when, in truth, he was also a victim of the illness. But who would know that in a play like this which is somewhat superficial. Even the ending was unrealistic. Disorders like these do not just resolve themselves very easily, if at all. On a more positive note, Ben Platt gave one of the most stellar performances that I have seen on Broadway. Mike Faest was superb as Conner and Will Roland was excellent as Jared. The rest of the ensemble also gave 4 and 5 star performances. The only actor that fell below was Rachel Bay Jones. She performed to those seated in the orchestra and the peons who paid $200 for balcony seats could barely hear her. In addition, her voice cracked in the last number of the show. Maybe she was just having an issue with her voice that night. But another annoyance was that the cast only played to the orchestra, hardly ever looking at the balcony. I would say that there are no bad seats in this theater and the balcony should have been satisfactory had the actors engaged us as well. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul's score was very good. There are reasons to see the show but without Ben Platt, just not sure.	321	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Ben Platt was spectacular	shapgo
158	November 8, 2017	This has fantastic music. smallest cast and least props of any show I have seen - BUT - one of the most powerful shows. The range of the lead singer's voice was amazing, it will be a huge loss to the company when he is no longer the lead. Definitely recommend this to a more mature audience.	64	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Sad but wonderful	Scottie96
326	November 23, 2017	I love the message - You will be found. Such an important thing to understand. I sent my 2 daughter’s to Ben Platt’s last weekend of playing the starring role. They had a wonderful time. Thank you to the writers and production of this show. You’ve done a good thing :)	119	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Love the Message	Gary A
106	November 25, 2017	Going to the theater is my passion. I have seen shows in venues around the world and have enjoyed almost all of them (except the Book of Mormon!). But no show has ever moved me as deeply as this show. The music, the singing, and the message are all incredibly powerful. We already knew most of the soundtrack. Still, my 18 year old son and I cried throughout the whole show. My mother and daughter did not cry (how is that possible?) but they really enjoyed the music and the singing. Don't miss this one.	55	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Best show I have ever seen	familytravl
3	September 6, 2017	Literally a week before going to show, notified that star Ben Platt no longer doing matinees. Of course no other tickets available -- really shabby way to treat fans.	4	1	Dear Evan Hansen	Last minute pulling the plug	Jerry M
79	September 11, 2017	"I am a born and raised New Yorker. I have seen dozens and dozens of shows. I see almost everything. I won the lottery for 2 tickets for a Saturday night so we went. That said, I thought this show was just OK. Yes, the lead, Ben Platt, was very good in his role. I didn't know who he was but, when he came out on stage, the young people in the audience went crazy and I read that he was from Pitch Perfect. He put his all into the performance but, at times, he spoke too fast and mumbled and I totally missed what he was saying. I wasn't sure if he was in character or if he was rushing his lines because he says them every day and is burning out. The message of the show is a good one and relevant to teens today. The show ran 2 and a half hours which I felt could be scaled down to 1 hour 45 minutes. None of the songs were memorable to me. My husband felt the same way as me about the show and he usually takes the opposite opinion of anything I say so that is telling. I was surprised at the amount of reviewers saying that they were crying at the end of the first act. I cry at TV commercials and almost anything else but I felt no emotion at this show. The girl in front of us was crying at the end and it seemed others were, too, but, again, it didn't tug at my heart strings. This is just my opinion and I realize that it's very different from most other reviewers here. Be warned: the ""f"" word is used many, many times throughout the show. If you are visiting from out of town and have limited time to see a show, I highly recommend Come From Away. It is simply fantastic and you will leave the theater on a pure high."	35	3	Dear Evan Hansen	It was just OK	Kiki2010
340	September 13, 2017	This is a very depressing show, the actors are extremely talented so I just tried to concentrate on their ability and voices. The subject of suicide and teen depression is a tough one, not sure I want to be entertained by it. I did to like the vulgar language, even though I realize that is reality, again not entertaining.	89	2	Dear Evan Hansen	Very Depressing	chefbaby2013
48	September 16, 2017	"I'm a guy. I am usually not comfortable with ""tear jerker"" movies or shows. This was incredible. Lead, Ben Platt not doing matinees so Michael Lee Brown performed. I cannot fathom someone doing the role better. He poured himself into it. A TRUE actor.  The show had very important messages that should be seen by all. The music was good, but not as memorable as say ""Rent"".  Highly recommend to all. "	11	5	Dear Evan Hansen	OMG. Understudy for lead was INCREDIBLE 	eabgolfer
228	September 17, 2017	The understudy for Evan Hansen was fantastic. The understudy for Evan's mother was having a terrible night. She sounded bad and came off as an uncaring mother, which wasn't her role; no emotion. She was the only member of the cast who wasn't on. The first act was a ton of fun. I laughed a lot and found it touching. The second act was SO DEPRESSING! It was tough. So much ugly crying. So much sadness. So little hope. At intermission I texted a friend and told him he had to take his mom. At the end of the show I texted him and took it back. Good show. Heavy. Know what you're getting into. 	88	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Amazing act 1; act 2 is tough 	Wellington24
20	September 19, 2017	"I am a serious theater goer. So, when I say that Ben Platt gives one of the great performances in Broadway history, please take note. There are few roles in musicals that are so raw and riveting. Patti Lupone in ""Gypsy."" Mandy Patinkin in ""Sunday in the Park with George."" Ben Platt's emotional breakdown during ""Words Fail,"" is of that caliber. When he is on stage, one recalls how truly electric and transporting theater can be. This part was tailor-made for him and I imagine that all others will play Ben Platt playing Evan Hansen.  Aside from his performance, this is a very good, but flawed show. From the same director, Michael Greif, as ""Next to Normal,"" the shows share many similarities. Both focus on mental illness and a main character in crisis. Though the two shows have different composers, even the music sounds similar. The first act is solid, but the second feels unfocused. But Platt's performance covers a multitude of sins."	71	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Ben Platt - 5 stars. Dear Evan Hansen - 3 stars	jlasf
4	September 21, 2017	This was an amazing musical! Michael Lee Brown was incredible as lead. He was so believable in his role. The whole cast was wonderfully talented. This is a musical that I highly recommend and will see at least two more times.	20	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Incredible musical	mackaydon
227	September 24, 2017	I paid ridiculous stubhub prices in order to see this before Ben Platt left. Worth every penny. Such a heart-wrenching, emotional journey. Not every play can cause you to feel a full spectrum of emotions but this play captures that. This is the type of play that everyone should see. Whether you relate to the Evan Hansen character or you're the opposite of him you'll get something out of it. Such a strong message and well worth the pricey ticket costs to go see it. Ben Platt was incredible, sad he's leaving but I'm sure the next guys will be great too. Mike Faist is the most adorable thing and did a fantastic job as Conner...one of my new favorite broadway actors. Will Roland was also a highlight for me. Did such a great job bringing humor and sarcasm into the show which I loved. Overall show is amazing, definitely made it into my top 5! 	101	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Full spectrum of emotions in one play!	MelissaClaire93
183	September 24, 2017	"When my wife told me we were attending this performance and it was a ""TEAR JERKER"", I asked why are we going?  The Theater like most are small and old but I doubt that there many bad seats. Even the seats were a bit more comfortably spaced, I've been to some where you're on your neighbors lap.  The concept of the play is one many can relate to. It's about the struggle to fit into a mold of what is excepted. We all know individuals who struggle to fit in at school, work or communities. Ben Platt performance was by far the best I have ever seen on stage or the big screen. ""I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO TOUCHED!"" I, like most of the attendees laughed and cried because we have all been there."	180	5	Dear Evan Hansen	I have Never been so touched!	Michael Z
9	August 8, 2017	For my family, seeing this show was a huge deal. Living across the country, we don't see Broadway shows very often, and I am a huge musical fan. Even before I saw the show, I had all the songs memorized, but the show exceeded all my expectations.  Our seats were nosebleed. We were in the balcony, the farthest ones back, but that didn't take away from the experience whatsoever.  Unfortunately, the one week we went was when Ben Platt was on vacation. This was a huge bummer, seeing as he's the star of the show, but my family decided to look at it as excuse to see it again. Michael Lee Brown was the understudy, and he did a phenomenal job as well. He had huge shoes to fill, and he lived up to the challenge and was incredibly talented. This is one of those shows where seeing it live is really a whole different experience from listening to the soundtrack. The lighting is amazing, and how they convey social media, texting, talking on the phone, and other more modern things that aren't easy to portray on stage is so well done. Although there are no huge dance numbers, the choreography is so fitting to the tone of the musical, and makes it all the better. For a relatively sad musical overall, the jokes are hilarious. From Zoe's commentary about her family to Jared's one liners, they're modern and actually funny. People who don't normally enjoy Broadway shows can enjoy this one, due the the relevancy and humor. The rest of the cast was absolutely amazing. Rachel Bay Jone's tony was well deserved, as was Mike Faist's nomination. For a show with no ensemble and only 8 total characters, every actor held his/her own and really added to the musical. The show was so well done that I cried throughout the entire thing. Starting at the second song and continuing to the end, I was fairly dehydrated afterwards. While this was in large part due to the fact that I'm a huge Broadway nerd, the lines in songs like You Will Be Found, Words Fail, and So Big/So Small really touched on insecurities and worries that I, as a real teenager, have today. Overall, thats what really sets the show apart. The authenticity, and just the realness. It touches on an issue often not portrayed, or shown correctly, in today's media, and doesn't romanticize it. Connor's suicide isn't beautiful and romantic. It's awful, for everyone involved, and really shows how someone's death effects those around them. The portrayal of Evan's anxiety is raw and relatable, for anyone who has ever felt alone or on the outside. The show shows how both parents and child see it, and really connects the two generations. I was a different person walking out of that theater than I was when I walked in. Even three weeks later, the show resonates with me, and I'll carry that with me forever. Adult or teen, broadway fan or not, do yourself a favor and see this show. You wouldn't regret it.	5	5	Dear Evan Hansen	The Best Broadway Show I've Ever Seen	Campbell S
93	August 9, 2017	Dear TripAdvisor Readers, This was a great day. I, along with my 14 yr old daughter and 11 year old son saw Dear Evan Hansen on 7-24-17 at 8 pm, a Tuesday. Our seats were at orchestra row e seats 6-10. So we were on the right side of the theater really close to the stage. But I would say there isn't a bad seat in the house in this 984 seat theater. I would agree with the other reviewers that this is just an amazing and wonderful musical. Despite its serious themes including teen isolation, anxiety, depression and suicide, against the backdrop of single parenting and a dysfunctional family and the power of social media, this musical provides a lesson in redemption and love. The musical ultimately states that you are not alone and will be found. The title role is brilliantly played by Ben Platt and the supporting cast is just awesome. The music is wonderful and also brilliant. The cast elicited a lot of emotion from the audience  Including my family. I was crying at the end of the first act and my son was towards the end. The fact that this musical elicited such responses from the audience just shows us how great it is and how great the cast executed the plot, themes and music.   What made this really special is that my friend Nathaniel Hill of Broadway VIP services arranged for us to go back stage to meet Will Roland who played Jared Kleinman in the production. He was also brilliant in the musical. He provided my daughter with some career advice which she is taking to heart. But the coolest part was when Nathaniel walked us past the barriers to the stage door while the adoring fans waited for the actors to appear. Just an awesome wonderful experience. Sincerely, Me. 	106	5	Dear Evan Hansen	You Will Be Found 	Oblio10
78	August 13, 2017	Took my daughter to see this on the opening preview - it was great! She loved it. It's a modern musical, and kids today will relate to it. You will also have waving through a window playing in your head for months afterward lol!	88	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Waving through a window	Kristina H
30	August 14, 2017	I am not a crier and I cried pretty much from halfway through the first song through the entire show. This was amazing on many levels -- the set was fresh and helped to communicate the content/tone of the play, the acting was unbelievable (I have goosebumps now just thinking about it) and this was for not only the main character but the supporting cast as well. I don't know how the main character does this day after day! This is a must see if you are not afraid of going into an ocean of deep raw emotion.	3	5	Dear Evan Hansen	My #1 of All Time!	A S
102	August 20, 2017	Worth every penny and all the hype. Ben Platt and this cast are truly legends in their craft. Thanks for sharing such a heartfelt and relatable story.	98	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Ah-mazing.	AlexBuckFL
147	August 25, 2017	Powerful show and message. The role is a huge undertaking. We saw Colton Ryan in it as Platt has been out with vocal cord rest (understandably too much for someone to do 6 days/week.) Colton was amazing and has been the understudy all year. He did not disappoint. However, the understudy for Evan's mother was subpar and underwhelming in her acting and singing. Other peformers-Mike Faist who played Connor was excellent in every moment he was on stage- I hope to see more of him on Broadway. Laura Dreyfuss has a beautiful voice. This is a small theater and all seats are good in orchestra, did not see mezz so cannot speak for,	76	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Terrfic show	glenside
126	August 31, 2017	"I see a lot of shows.....I mean really a lot. I love theater and I live here! I wasn't willing to spend scalpers prices for this one so I figured I would just never see it. Then a friend called and said she had two extra tickets that she bought and would I be interested? Are you kidding? Standing in the huge line to get in, I suddenly heard that Ben Platt was out on voice rest. WHAT? But there was nothing I could do. So I sadly went to my seat and said to myself, ""IT'S JUST A SHOW""! That's what people need to remember. It's about the show...the message...the meaning. And the understudy was superb! I couldn't imagine anyone being better. So don't get hung up on who's in it....see it and take away the beautiful message. Learn what loneliness is all about. This is a show for everyone...every parent, every teacher, every young person....everyone. Enjoy!"	74	5	Dear Evan Hansen	EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS SHOW	nezzie
451	September 2, 2017	"This was a sad but beautifully written and performed play about a teenager, perhaps a bit autistic, who ""grows up"" before our very eyes. Unfortunately, the actor who usually plays Evan Hansen, Ben Platt, was out for a few days for ""voice strain."" His understudy provided a credible performance, but it seemed he was a bit out of tune a few times. In spite of the serious theme, this IS a musical and the music adds a great deal to the overall atmosphere. The story itself is compelling and the play's appeal is certainly partly because we have all known or experienced people and situations similar to those in the play. The Music Box is a great little theater; it's so small that there may not be a bad seat in the house. Unfortunately, most of the performances were sold out, and I had to buy a ticket on the secondary market ($300 for a second row center mezzanine seat). There is a ticket lottery, but as usual, I didn't win. This play is great entertainment-for the story, the music, and emotion it evokes."	164	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Poignant	james p
597	September 2, 2017	Must see show for everyone, especially families of teenagers. Ben Platt is great--lots of pressure on his replacement. All the awards are well deserved. Great story and great acting by the entire cast.	97	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Fantastic show about important topic	RonFG
21	July 19, 2017	Excellent vocal and acting performances really carry this show. It's amazing that the cast can deliver such powerful performances day after day. The set design is not anything exciting but I did think having the musicians visible on stage was a cool element, especially since the music is probably the best part of the show. Definitely an interesting story. Lots of raw emotion, but themes are presented in a pretty straight forward manner so I didn't find a lot of deep meaning in the show. We bought tickets earlier this year, prior to the Tony buzz, but I think I let the subsequent hype build up my expectations a little too much. The crowd was somewhat interesting as well, and the atmosphere almost had the feeling of a concert, what with the rockstar status of Ben Platt. Not surprisingly the crowd skewed younger than most Broadway shows, but a lot of people could not sit still, stay quiet, or keep their phones off during the show. Not typical theater etiquette in short. Still, it was a great production and it was exciting to see a freshly minted Tony winner. Go in with reasonable expectations and you'll have a great time.	16	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Dear Evan Hansen - Original Cast	TKRandall
40	July 21, 2017	I know everybody says this show is wonderful, fantastic, best show they've ever seen. I personally cannot say that I had those feelings toward this show. It is very relevant to teens in this day and age of the internet and social technology, but it left me and many other people that I spoke with afterwards feeling as I did... very unattached and not as emotional as everyone said I would be. This shows message is very current today but it just did not strike me. The actors we're good and the music was good but the storyline I felt just was flat for me. This is my personal opinion but I feel there are other shows out there that are more worthy	16	2	Dear Evan Hansen	Didn't care for show	Stacey P
42	July 21, 2017	I didn't really know much about the Broadway musical Dear Evan Hansen when I bought tickets for it several month ago for our trip in July except that it was new and had good reviews. In fact, I wasn't too sure if my husband and I would like it, but we figured our daughter who just graduated high school would probably enjoy it. Well, we all LOVED it. The cast was outstanding. It made me laugh and it made me cry. I highly recommend going to see it!	21	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Amazing!	Toodles4now
285	July 24, 2017	The musical is excellent, but totally overshadowed by Ben Platt's amazing performance. He captures the essence of teenage angst in the most believable fashion. Some of the music is memorable which beats most of the fare, today. All of the actors are excellent and the story os told in a way that makes everyone in the audience pine for the elusive good ending. Get a ticket at any cost. 	94	5	Dear Evan Hansen	One of the most amazing performances 	Allen L
14	July 26, 2017	It wasn't just the music, which was amazing, or the plot that portrays the complications of being an adolescent in a world where social media plays such a huge and complicating role in everyone's lives. It was the incredibly talented cast, especially Ben Platt. I would go see it again & again, if any tickets were available.	3	5	Dear Evan Hansen	No Words	Janie R
14	July 27, 2017	"In April, I walked out of the show after about 15 minutes because Ben Platt was not appearing in that performance. His understudy may have been fine, but in clips I saw on the internet, Ben Platt blew me away.  I attended the show yesterday, and WOW, Ben Platt is incredible!!! I don't think I've ever witnessed such emotions coming from an actor, and I've been attending the theater for 50 years. I'm glad I got to go back, and see the ""real"" Evan Hansen."	81	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Amended Review from April, 2017	amefromnyc
26	July 29, 2017	"""Dear Evan Hansen"" and Ben Platt's stellar performance moved me to tears – from the first notes of ""Waving Through a Window"" through intermission to the standing ovation as the actors took their bows. The show is stunning, and its characters are so deeply flawed that you can't help but feel the music in your gut because you recognize your darkest thoughts in the words coming from the stage. "	12	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Moving, important 	tlee102
64	August 4, 2017	I purchased tickets for my daughter and myself several months ago (thankfully before the Tony Awards). This is the best show I have ever seen. Ben Platt is a genius. We laughed and cried all the way through the performance. Every member of the cast was excellent. I highly recommend this show - especially for teenagers and parents with teenagers. It covers many affects of social media and anxiety that haunts many kids today. It's worth every dollar you will spend on the tickets. The theater employees are also very helpful and friendly!	22	5	Dear Evan Hansen	YOU MUST SEE THIS SHOW!!!	MPRH11
1231	June 9, 2017	You will never forget seeing this awesome musical. It will win the Tony on Sunday. Make sure you don't get a front row seat because some are difficult to see the actors and my seat had a wall one foot from my face. Which is probably why we got these tickets in the first place. But I would do it again to see this musical. 	290	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Emotional and powerful 	fizzy1991
185	June 10, 2017	I have to say I was super pi**ed two hours before the show when we found out Ben Platt would not be performing. We have waited 7 months and traveled 2500 miles. However we were not giving up our tix and we went to the show. From start to finished it was amazing. Even the songs I didn't necessarily love from the soundtrack came to life and had a whole new meaning. Dear Evan Hansen was an emotional caring show that made me laugh and cry. Each cast member was excellent including Colton Ryan who played Evan that night. This is a must see. Good luck to them on June 11th and the Tonys. They deserve a bunch. 	68	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Must see show even with understudy 	Leslie O
51	August 4, 2017	I must say that after having seen Dear Evan Hansen, it just might be one of the more important musicals I have ever seen. It resonated with me in the same way that Next to Normal did. Both very wrenching experiences in their own way. For those who say DEH is a poor man's Next to Normal though, I don't agree. They are two different musicals with different themes.  I was terribly moved by NtoN, even though I couldn't completely connect with the leading character or the experiences she was going through. Still it captured my emotions in an amazing way. Similarly, DEH was simply outstanding, but it definitely resonated with me on a more personal level than NtoN did.  Though I loved both musicals, DEH was more personal for me. And I connected to it in a more powerful way. Ben Platt is giving a tour de force performance. I almost could't take my eyes off him, observing his every emotion, his every facial expression, his every movement. How he invests himself in this difficult role nightly is truly inspirational. Rachel Bay Jones, as his mother, was equally exceptional. The two of them together are mesmerizing and the connection (or lack thereof early on in the musical) they have is so believable. They carry you to a different place. My friend and I forked out more than face value of the experience and we're both so glad we did. No regrets whatever. This show is a must see. It was remarkable in much the say way that NtoN was. But comparing them is a little off kilter as they both take different journeys. And both are superbly emotional each in their own right.	51	5	Dear Evan Hansen	A stirring and insightful musical	SurfriderCA
200	June 11, 2017	When a play makes you laugh, cry and emotionally feel the story - this is a great play. The music and story, the actors and scene sets were so real and full of life. I did not fully understand what the 'meat' of this play was before I went. It is full of reality and makes one stop and think about any and all actions we take daily. Ben Platt and cast are very, very talented.	52	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Powerful Reality Play in Today's Society - A Must to See	Pepsi38
156	June 21, 2017	I took a group of middle/high school students to this play as part of a theatre trip from Texas. I can tell you that these children and I are forever changed after seeing this play. We were all sobbing and hugging at the end. It is a story that all students and parents need to see. It is very timely. It reminds us that we are all people and that everyone deserves to be seen and remembered. What a beautiful and inspirational piece. It more than deserved every Tony it won. Bravo all!!!!	60	5	Dear Evan Hansen	#you will be found and changed	aamirabella
196	June 21, 2017	"What happens when you become a viral sensation based on a lie? Granted not an intentional deception but one that grows out of control in nanoseconds as social media has become the intoxicating drug for anyone who succumbs to its immediate impact. That's what happens to the 17-year-old title character who is dealing with his debilitating post-adolescent angst by writing encouraging letters to himself. Evan's divorced mother Heidi has pushed him to perform this daily task on behalf of his therapist, and it was one such letter that became the catalyst for a series of events that turns Evan into an instant viral celebrity. The linchpin of the story is fellow high school outcast Connor who angrily expresses his frustration. The letter brings him emotionally closer to Connor's family because they and the rest of the world think it was a suicide note from Connor as he shared his secrets to Evan as a reflection of their presumed close friendship. With a book by Steven Levenson that delves fluently into issues like mental health and teen suicide under Michael Greif's thoughtful direction, this turned out to be a highly engaging production attended at this performance by quite a few enthusiastic pre-teens. In a genuinely moving turn, Ben Platt played Evan with a fervent vulnerability that exposed his character's soul through his constant fidgeting, fast-talking hyper-babble, and a voice that pierced the heart. Sounding very much like Jason Mraz, he sang with soaring clarity. He's in the spotlight on several knockout numbers such as ""Waving Through a Window"", ""For Forever"", and ""If I Could Tell Her"". But Platt was not the only standout as Rachel Bay Jones movingly conveyed helpless confusion and inner strength as Heidi with her big Act II solo about abandonment. ""So Big/So Small"". In fact, a palpable sense of isolation infused all the characters including Connor's parents searching for answers, overachieving Alana who anoints herself mourner-in-chief, and Zoe, Connor's sister and Evan's long-time crush touchingly played by Laura Dreyfuss. The infectious pop-oriented music is by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, who wrote the lyrics for ""La La Land"". The 23-year-old Platt is definitely a talent to watch."	429	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Ben Platt soars as a lonely teen who becomes a viral sensation based on a lie	Ed_Uyeshima
20	June 24, 2017	Saw this today with my husband and 2 teenagers. I have been listening to the album daily for the past month. This single experience is going to make me question taking any other vacation other than returning to NYC for shows shows SHOWS!!!! We also saw Anastasia and Aladdin. All amazing. But the relevancy of Dear Evan Hansen touched the most tender place in our hearts. Not one of us was dry eyed. Ben Platt and the entire cast rocked. I found myself holding my breath at different points and gasping....  starting to tear up again NOW! hahaha Just GO GO GO It IS WORTH THE BIZARRE TICKET PRICE! Tender and beautiful.	19	5	Dear Evan Hansen	WOW!!! THIS IS WHY I LOVE THE THEATRE!!!!	michelelane
38	June 26, 2017	This was my daughter's first choice of a Broadway musical, with Ben Platt being the main reason. To find out the night before that Ben would not be performing as Evan was disappointing to say the least. However, the show was fantastic even without Ben. All of the cast members were excellent including the understudy (Colton Ryan) who played Evan. The subject matter is relevant to today's teens; this is a must see play. It was great to see that they took home a few Tonys...well deserved. 	3	5	Dear Evan Hansen	A must see....deserved all the awards it received!	PBW4
652	July 4, 2017	"Ben Platt is amazing, although I hear wonderful things about his understudy. Very well written show. Is it as good as Hamilton? I'd have to say ""no"", but it's got to be one of the Top 5 shows currently playing. There are a few ""ok, I'll buy that"" parts that you have to agree to in order to really fall for DEH, but if you do that it's a great story. Not the kind of show you can really see multiple times (like Hamilton) but definitely worth seeing once!"	169	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Deserves the Tony Awards it won	Northern_Traveler00
3	July 8, 2017	I don't know how this show received less than 5 stars on here. I am a HUGE fan of Broadway- I see a show 2-3 times a year. I listened to the soundtrack before coming, and the words are very powerful. That soundtrack does not do justice to Ben Platt's phenomenal performance. This show is worth all the hype and the Tony awards that it has won. 	1	5	Dear Evan Hansen	A must see show	Valerie M
70	May 10, 2017	Such an important show with great music. Everyone can relate to some part of this story. The acting was incredible. Especially by Ben Platt. Bring on the Tonys!	27	5	Dear Evan Hansen	An Important show that everyone can relate to.	Kelsey B
67	May 11, 2017	The play was Marvelous Just Marvelous! Perfect new age tragedy comedy. Immaculately done and spot on singing just perfect pitch! Anyway very lovable and believable characters set was dream come true yet script is lacking morality play for consequences for unscrupulous behavior. Definitely new age script lacking that moral punch leaving no real personal responsibility for actions. Yet still extremely engaging and just beyond belief acting and music. What a treat!!	11	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Music box is an awesome venue! Not a bad seat in the house	rogersgreen
96	May 16, 2017	Dear Evan Hansen got rave reviews and is expected to walk with the Best Musical Tony. It should. Its one of the best shows I've seen in a long long time. I loved the staging, the story, the sets, the songs, and the acting. The lead male performance by Ben Platt is one of the best ever. If he doesnt win the Tony it will be one of the biggest upsets ever. So sorry that you have to wait to see it until 2018 if you dont have tickets. Its the hottest show in town, for a reason. I'm going again with my BF next January. 	42	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Love Love Love this show.	rob788
75	May 24, 2017	Amazing- I've been thinking about the performance since we saw it. The music is fantastic and the cast is phenomenal. It's a small theater so seating was tight but you forget everything except the people on stage. Ben Platt blew my mind with his talent and ability to make this character come to life. A must see.	27	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Amazing In Every Way	Off2Vaca
29	May 25, 2017	A new musical with a strange plot involving high school student suicide. It was surprisingly compelling. The music and the actors are wonderful. The audience reaction was unbelievably intense. It is packed with emotion as well as comedy. Nominated for nine Tony awards, is a strong indication that this is a show that you shouldn't miss.	20	5	Dear Evan Hansen	A great theater experience	Ron N
123	May 29, 2017	"I have been lucky enough to see 12 Broadway musicals this year including Hamilton and Waitress (which were both beyond outstanding). In my opinion, Dear Evan Hansen is the best I have seen. It pains me to say this as I loved Hamilton. What makes Dear Evan Hansen so amazing? It touches you on so many levels. Quite honestly it is emotionally draining.  How? The show stars Ben Platt as Evan Hansen who has severe anxiety, lonely and separated from every one around him. I have seen his character described as socially awkward...that is a gross understatement. You can't even imagine how difficult it is for him to interact with people socially without seeing it. Ben Platt performs a Tony worthy performance (if he doesn't win I would be shocked). There are not words to adequately describe how powerful is his performance and nothing I could write could prepare you for it. So how is this relatable?  While Evan Hanson's character takes his feelings of separation, anxiety and loneliness to an extreme....today we all feel more and more separated from each other. Loneliness is everywhere....even in the middle of a crowd. You really feel his separation in a personal way. The challenges of parenting. And when you aren't relating to Evan Hansen (if you have kids) you are relating to his and Connor Murphy's parents. Evan's mother is expertly played by Rachel Bay Jones as a struggling divorced single parent as a nursing assistant aspiring to be a paralegal...or Connor and Zoey's parents a successful lawyer and stay at home mom...realize they are all doing the best they can, but fear they are coming up short or pushing their kids too hard...or pushing them in the wrong direction.....or just away. Haven't we all felt that way? You feel the anguish of Connors's parents over his suicide. They are devastated and guilt ridden and reach out to Connor's 'Best Friend' as a life preserver.  I don't want to give too much of the plot away. There of plenty of reviews that go into more plot detail. As Maya Angelou famously said... ""At the end of the day people won't remember what you said or did, they will remember how you made them feel."" If you see Dear Evan Hansen be prepared to feel and you will never forget this show."	72	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Relatable, emotional masterpiece 	Chris1620
177	June 2, 2017	I recently saw Dear Evan Hansen. Of all the shows I have been both off and on Broadway, this show was by far the most incredible show I have ever seen! The cast is amazingly talented and the show itself offers such a great exploration of the complexities of life for families and teens today. The show is excellent! I would highly recommend this deep and moving show for anyone who is interested in a great experience in the city!	52	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Incredible Show!	Douglas W
1	June 5, 2017	Overall, a fantastic experience. I didn't know what to expect considering this was my first Broadway experience, and wow was I in for a great show. I was blown away by the talent of the cast, quality of the music, and the story telling ability of the musical. The performers were all very skilled and gave a very moving and enthusiastic performance. Ben Platt kills it as Evan Hansen and all of the other actors and actresses fit their roles perfectly as well. The music is very memorable and fits in seamlessly with the dialogue. 10/10, a must-see.	1	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Dear Evan Hansen - Amazing	Steven P
51	June 6, 2017	Phenomenal show!!! This show is so incredibly intense with an extremely powerful message. My daughter wanted to see this show and I initially didn't care if I saw it or not. Oh my goodness!!! I am so thankful that I got to see it! I would definitely see this again! If Ben Platt doesn't win the Best Actor in a Musical Tony, there is no justice in this world!	10	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Phenomenal!!	idratherbeboatin
460	April 10, 2017	i had heard that this was the musical this year and in January had to wait until April for 2 orchestra seats. It was well worth the wait. Ben Platt is amazing as are his cast members and i can tell you that there isn't anyone who isn't moved by this innovative, emotionally touching show. 	123	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Run and get your tickets before it wins the Tony	Msmouse1
30	April 11, 2017	From start to finish wonderful - perfectly caste, great story and music. Everyone will be able to see something they relate to from their school years. Very moving story which was enhanced by the songs which were perfection. One piece of advice: the stage is very high up so if you do not want neck pain at end of show (which runs about 2 1/2 hours) do not get seats in first 3 rows.	26	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Wonderful	Jane O
350	April 19, 2017	Word of warning, do not put on a lot of eye makeup before going to this show and make sure to use water-proof mascara if you must put on some makeup. There was not a dry eye in the house when all was said and done. The story is very modern, very relevant, perhaps geared more to younger audiences or parents of high-schoolers, but it doesn’t make it less touching to the rest of us. Ben Platt deserves a Tony nomination, if not a win, for his role as Evan Hansen.	176	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Ben Platt deserves a Tony	buttercup1211
27	April 19, 2017	A great musical for sure. The performance was simply AMAZING! Ben Platt owns that character. The rest of the cast was equally awesome. A treat to watch and the whole production should be very proud of the product they had on stage tonight. So great to see hard work and dedication in action. Truly priceless. See it if you can!	8	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Amazing!!!	chiroteam
355	April 24, 2017	We've seen a lot of Broadway and this past weekend I took our 17-year-old daughter to see this because I knew once the Tony's aired I wouldn't be able to get a ticket.  Ben Platt owns it. He completely owns it and he better own a Tony in June or there's something wrong with the voting system. He sang his heart out and just became this character. I found out later that he was acting and singing with a sinus infection. I can't imagine who he sounds without one. I don't want to tell you what it's about because I didn't know and I was glad I didn't. Just bring some tissues and buy the CD because the music is so meaningful and beautiful. A very very special show that high schoolers and adults will relate to.	143	5	Dear Evan Hansen	This is a special and exceptional show.	crapschick
295	April 26, 2017	Our theatre-loving teens were eager to get tickets to this show and were delighted when we found some on Stub Hub. (Be aware of the mature content before taking small children.) Ben Platt was remarkable in his performance, and the entire cast is quite strong.	95	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Drama with a message	Sandi B
6	April 30, 2017	The actor's, the script, the music, the setting, all excellent. I really enjoyed this musical but I had reservations about the message. Everyone tries to tell someone that has suicidal thoughts that nothing good will come from carrying it out but there are lots of good things that come out of Connor's suicide. Someone that's on the edge may take it the wrong way. I suppose that you can't have a play with social commentary without some controversy and uneasiness so go see it.	2	5	Dear Evan Hansen	excellent musical	LAWRENCE Y
64	May 3, 2017	This show is the best musical that has ever come to broadway. It is a musical with a powerful message about honesty and friendship. Ben Platt sparkles and owns the role of Evan and his voice is simply remarkable. Another stand out character is Will Roland who plays Jared. He is absolutely hysterical. Orchestra seats are a must for a show of this caliber. In addition, I was able to wait stage door for signatures and met Morgan Freeman. If celebrities such as him are attending this show, obviously it is something to marvel at. This show deserves Best Musical at the Tonys this year. 	21	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Best musical ever!	20jack03
64	May 3, 2017	I picked up a same day ticket for this show on StubHub while in New York for business. The ticket (front row, mezzanine, left) was sold at what appeared to be face value plus typical StubHub fees. This show has a powerful message with tremendous performances by all. Come prepared to shed some tears. Tickets will likely be harder to get and/or more expensive with all of the Tony award nominations, so I am glad I had the chance to see it when I did.	26	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Phenomenal show	David R
197	March 10, 2017	This show is difficult to get tickets to now but I believe it will be near impossible after it wins numerous Tony Awards in June. The story, the music, and (Of course) Ben Platt. Probably my favorite new musical since Rent debuted many years ago.	103	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Dear TONY Hansen	Andrew S
162	March 18, 2017	I saw this show tho afternoon with my 17 year old daughter. I only knew a little bit about the story line and that Ben Platt was the lead. This show exceeded all of expectations. It was well worth the price of the tickets. Ben Platt played the role of socially awkward Evan Hansen so well. The rest of the cast was fantastic as well. This is a show that teens and their families will enjoy and can open the door to some very hard to talk about subjects with teens. Just one word of caution. This show is not for young children, I would caution taking anyone younger than 15 to see this. I don't normally say this but this is one show that I would pay to see again. 	60	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Awesome Show Loved Everything 	piercka1
54	March 20, 2017	One of the most touching musicals I have EVER seen. Can't tell you how many times I was moved to tears - could not speak when the show was over. Go! And if you have a teenager, make him/ her go with you!	21	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Fantastic!	Tom V
169	March 24, 2017	The entire cast is truly superb with some great songs, but this show isn't as epic as Hamilton and the ticket prices seem too steep in my opinion. My daughter wanted to see it so we waited in cancellation line and got great seats, but we both wished we had seen something more upbeat our last night in NYC. It might win Tonys, but I don't see it still playing a year from now. That said, teen girls are nuts for it and it was a high quality show about challenging and emotional subject.	76	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Terrific performances	PattyB789
12	March 26, 2017	We saw Dear Evan Hansen during the previews and it is an absolute must see. Ben Platt is AMAZING as Evan Hansen. The singing and acting are outstanding. The story sends a feel good message of compassion for the shy, lonely, unpopular teenagers out there. It's the perfect play for high school class trips and will enjoyable to teenagers and adults.	3	5	Dear Evan Hansen	"Don't ""Be in the Outside Looking In""- a must see!"	Fscoop
143	April 1, 2017	excellent musical, n challenging script--not for everyone--esp. kids under 12. deals openly with important subject--misfits in high school	20	5	Dear Evan Hansen	challenging musical	susan T
127	April 3, 2017	I can't say enough about this incredible musical. The entire cast is superb, but Ben Platt delivers an emotional performance that I have no idea how he sustains day after day. The theater was comfortable and music sensational.  The theme is very poignant and timely - a critical 'must see' for families with teenagers. Strong language may be inappropriate for younger kids.	35	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Absolutely incredible! 	GlobalOkie
10	April 5, 2017	My wife and I saw the show last week on the day we got into the city. We had not bought tickets in advance, but had no other plans that night and wanted to try to get in. The show was at 8 pm, we got there at about 6 pm and asked whether there was a standby or cancellation line. We found out that they had just released and sold 5 canceled tickets, and no one else was there waiting so we decided to stand in line. A young woman came right after us, and within a few minutes, they released another single ticket, which we let her take. Another couple came and waited with us, and we also learned that they would probably not release any more tickets until show time. Others that joined the line behind us ended up buying tickets from a couple of people who showed up to sell theirs, but we were feeling good about our chances for cancellation tickets, so we continued waiting. Just before showtime, someone came from the box office to tell us that someone had canceled two great seats, so our waiting paid off big time. We went from having no tickets to paying face value for two seats that were 6th row on the aisle in the orchestra. They sold at least one more cancellation ticket that night because the guy sitting next to us had shown up right before showtime and also got his seat then. The show was great, my wife was thrilled at how things worked out. The highlight of the show, hands down, was Ben Platt's performance. We can't fathom how he puts so much into it, nearly every single day.	17	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Saw the show by waiting in the cancellation line	Matthew E
43	April 7, 2017	Amazing show that addresses teenage angst as well as suicide. This show is well done in that it weaves humor in to a devastating topic. I highly recommend this show. It is troubling, thought provoking and deeply moving. I would be mindful of the age of child that attends and think about the follow up conversations that may be needed afterwards.	9	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Great Show!!	Kristine P
395	February 7, 2017	So glad that we got to see this show with its original cast. Just an amazing cast with great voices and superb acting skills. The story is not an easy one. Evan is an awkward high schooler who inadvertently becomes involved with a grieving family. The whole situation is messy, complicated, and quite sad. But it is not all boo-hoo/depressing. There are light moments and the music is just awesome. Though there is a lot of sadness and feeling bad for the characters, by the end things tie up fairly nicely and you leave the theater slightly encouraged. Serious show. Great music. Incredible cast. Would definitely see this one again! As a matter of fact, this cast is likely to run away with several Tony's.	356	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Wow!	bloomcrew
78	February 10, 2017	Surely going to deliver a Tony to star Ben Platt, this newer (to Broadway) show is minimalist with a small cast and a basic set with a fictional social media feed on constant display. The focus is on the story, the heartfelt singing and an emotionally gripping performance from the leads that holds you and leaves you dabbing your eyes if not outright sobbing. There was not a dry eye in the place by the mid of the 2nd half of the show. It's draining but rewarding and I would see it again in a heartbeat. Mezz offers great seats, don't overpay for centre orchestra.	81	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Moving, emotional and worth every penny	phoodee
138	February 13, 2017	One hint - read about it first so you will catch on right away - powerful story and the acting and singing are excellent. This show will definitely make it as it is so creative with a unexpected story line that is flawlessly delivered. A must see.	50	5	Dear Evan Hansen	A must see	VJousan
168	February 13, 2017	"We went with mixed feelings about this show, which were totally unfounded. This show is ""A MUST SEE"". You really get so involved with the characters. It is excellent. The music will stay with you. The acting is terrific ! Evan Hansen is TONY bound and will probably win! Get tickets NOW!"	92	5	Dear Evan Hansen	EXCELLENT SHOW	HillaryNewYork
1094	February 16, 2017	This is show is just incredible. It's one of the most moving shows I have ever seen. Anyone can relate to this story: people who went to high school and had a hard time fitting in, or just people who went to high school (I don't know too many people who came out of high school emotionally unscathed), parents of teens. There isn't a large set or flashy dance numbers, but there is so much heart and so much talent.  Ben Platt delivers a powerful performance of a teen who just wants friends and to be noticed but doesn't really have the social tools to do so. When he finds a way he thinks will work, he starts to feel better about himself but creates a whole word of lies to do so. As you sit and watch him struggle through everything, you just feel so much for him. He is just so desperate to be loved but doesn't have the emotional maturity to know that what he is doing is wrong. In his mind the ends justify the means, until they don't. Ben Platt's power house vocals and incredible emotion draw you in and leave you wanting more. This is a show where you will be humming the songs for days. The theater is small so most seats are good honestly. DEH is gaining popularity so tickets are getting hard to come by and very pricey.	378	5	Dear Evan Hansen	An absolute must see	Jvalliant
68	February 22, 2017	This play is everything you want to see on Broadway. Acting is superb, music is fabulous, the storyline is unique and memorable though a subject that is heartwrenching. You laugh and cry. Ben Platt is so good that you don't even realize he's acting. Everyone on that stage is perfect and the original music is incredible. I wish they sold CDs because I could listen to those songs over and over again. They were beautifully written and sung. The storyline is intense though but Evan is has such a good heart, you fall in love with him. If you don't have tickets, like we didn't, then go and see if you can get in at the last minute. We did, center seats row 5...and it was fabulous. One of those plays that stays with you for a lifetime!	25	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Great isn't good enough to describe this!	Johnclarke27
45	February 23, 2017	Wasn't expecting much and didn't really know what the underlying storyline was. But the small cast and the ability to relate to each character was uncanny. Ben Platt is genius in this role--how does he do it? Funny, poignant, and sad--the entire range of emotions in one play. Incredible--go see this!	9	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Go and see this if you can!	Isgirl_in_MA
25	March 4, 2017	"I go to one broadway show a year for my wife's birthday. We live about 20 miles north of the city. I'm usually more excited about the dinner after than the show but I really enjoyed this one and I'm not a guy that loves shows. Music gave me goosebumps which I never had since ""Wicked"" and storyline was superb. A perfect balance between dark and light and perfect timing to keep each compatible. Lead character was crazy talented the way he could sing yet maintain character. Most of the other characters were great too."	9	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Great show	Steve S
39	March 6, 2017	I was lucky enough to see the show this weekend. I had been listening to the music beforehand and the show answered some questions. Ben (aka Evan) did an amazing job. I don't know how the cast does this show every day. Very emotionally draining for me, personally. I can't imagine it not hitting anyone who sees it deeply. The cast is wonderful. Make sure you go!	10	5	Dear Evan Hansen	OUTSTANDING SHOW!	LynneM755
368	January 15, 2017	This is a fabulous show with a beautiful story and excellent music. Definitely worth taking in if you live here or are looking for a show to see when here on vacation.	63	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Excellent Show	Lee L
176	January 15, 2017	It is an ubelievable and an amazing performance and amazing and relevant story with interesting moral implications. The music is spectacular. The cast is extremely talented, particularly Ben Platt. I would see it again and can't wait to buy the cd.	53	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Outstanding	Opinioned_traveler
609	January 16, 2017	The show Dear Evan Hansen is an electrifying, captivating new musical with an emotionally powerful and praiseworthy performance by Ben Platt in the lead role. Evan Hansen is an extremely anxious high school student, on medication and seeing a therapist for his sometimes debilitating condition. He has no friends and, for all intents and purposes, is invisible to his peers. He is alone, until a classmate commits suicide. Through an escalating series of lies, fueled by unceasing and insatiable social media networks, his stature and presence begin to change with unanticipated and distressing results. The book by Steven Levenson is an emotional rollercoaster of impassioned scenes and straightforward honesty that connects to today’s teenagers. The story can sometimes be agonizing to watch as the characters try to negotiate the new landscape that is developing, changing, and spiraling out of control all at once. But Dear Evan Hansen is not just about angst and crisis. It also focuses on the a multitude of relationships that are spawned and changed from the events on stage.  The score by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul is heartfelt with penetrating lyrics that explore the inner turmoil Evan is going through as he confronts a new reality. The songs can be raucous with an in-your-face impact. They are playful, with a serious undertone. And there are tender ballads that reach to the depths of the character’s souls as well as reveal the agony individuals feel upon the death of a son.   The cast, led by Ben Platt, is impressive, imbuing their characters with an intensity and delicacy that can be poignant as well as somber. Platt is the anchor. He is almost always on stage and singing the majority of the score. From his first entrance on stage, with nervous tics and darting eyes, you realize this is a young man that has fully taken his acting prowess to a heightened level. He is believable and authentic. The other members of the acting troupe include Laura Dreyfus as the sister of the deceased student, Zoe Murphy, and the one who Evan pines for. The young actress deftly projects a lost innocence and whirlwind of emotions as she tries to make sense of the sudden change in her family dynamics and personal life. Rachel Bay Jones, as Evan’s mother Heidi, aptly portrays a mother frustrated and panicked over a son she cannot reach. Jennifer Laura Thompson is superb as Cynthia Murphy, mother of the departed son. Her grief and confusion strikes a chord with the audience. Your body quivers with compassionate understanding as she pleas for any scrap of information about her enigmatic boy. Michael Park as the father, Larry Murphy, gives a finely etched portrait of a man aloof, at first, over the death of his son, who gradually begins to wrestle with his feelings, as he tries to come to grips with the sudden shake-up in his life. Mike Faist as Connor Murphy, the high school student who suddenly dies, gives a nicely layered performance in life and death. Will Roland as Evan’s “relationship friend,” Jared Kleinman, provides a good dose of comic relief to off-set the weighty mood of the show. Kristolyn Lloyd as high school classmate, Alana Beck, gives an understated and compelling performance. She is not unlike Evan Hansen in her anxiety and timidity.   Director Michael Greif, who has sensitively helmed other musicals with dysfunctional characters such as Next to Normal and Grey Gardens, skillfully guides the production from its inauspicious beginnings through to its cathartic ending. He smartly keeps Ben Platt center stage—aching and trying to find his pathway through the storm he has unleashed--with the other characters swirling around his nexus. Greif artfully incorporates the social media maelstrom through pulsating, ever-changing screens. He also intelligently allows the material to unfold naturally without calling undue attention to the series of events that are unfurling onstage. The creative team of scenic designer David Korins, Projection Designer Peter Nigrini, Lighting Designer Japhy Weideman and Sound Designer Nevin Steinberg show their expertise and presentation skills during scenes where the stage of the Music Box theater is transformed into a hive of activity with screens projecting social media buzz, lights and sound amplifying the dramatic tension.    Dear Evan Hansen, a gripping, dazzling new musical that speaks openly and directly to the culture of today.	184	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Best New Musical of the Season	W-Hartford_CT
113	January 17, 2017	I see a lot of Broadway, and I have not been this moved in years. The story is original; the lighting and staging is as much a part of the show as the actors. The acting is the best I have seen in years. Every single actor is Tony worthy. Ben Platt is beyond anything I could write. There is not a person that cannot identify with the show. I suggest getting Mezzanine tickets. I usually do not like the Mezzanine, but I sat there for Sunday, January 15th. I am so glad I did. You really can see all that the staging is and lightning. Go now.	19	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Must See	DKatz21
9	January 18, 2017	“Dear Evan Hansen” has almost nothing we associate with the big, splashy Broadway musical. There is no chorus—just 5 “teens” and 3 adults. There is no flashy choreography. There is little in the way of scenery—just social media images projected on flats made of black scrim and a few homey set pieces—a sofa, a bed. There is no big event—war, a ghost terrorizing a theatre, a comet arcing across the sky. And there are fewer songs, less singing and more dialogue in this day of often through-sung musicals. So what is there to love that justifies a ticket price of more than $100? How about a simple story of high school students with a misfit at its core that resonates with truth? And while there is no chorus, there are eight very talented people singing and acting their hearts out in a score that repeatedly soars with some of the best arias I’ve ever heard on the Broadway stage. At the center of it all is Ben Platt in the title role. His acting and singing are star-making. If a Tony doesn’t sit on his mantle by mid-June, there is no justice in the voting process. I’ve seen some iconic, legendary performances over the years (Angela Lansbury in “Sweeny Todd,” Anthony Hopkins in “Equus,” and Michael Crawford in “Phantom” to name a few). His work on this show resides in that territory. From his opening monologue delivered with machine-gun speed and perfect clarity to his final touching moments, his work is flawless. He is easily worth the price of admission. Add to that the very strong work by everyone else and you get musical theatre heaven. The show isn’t perfect. For the musical theatre purist, this may be a disappointment, since in many ways it is a play with music. At times I felt it hammered the same point home when subtlety would have worked better. A couple of the teenage characters never really rise above the level of stereotypes. If you’re easily offended by crude language, be warned that the high school characters actually talk like high school students. But these factors seem to make the right notes ring all the more true. How do audiences react to this simple tale about lies getting one a seat at the popular kids table? At the performance I saw the audience burst into applause and cheers when the lights came up on Platt sitting in his bed typing away on his laptop. Obviously his reputation preceded him. Number after soaring number was greeted with thunderous applause. If you’ve never actually seen a show with a literal showstopper, you will make up for it with this production. Probably a half-dozen times the actors had to hold while the audience went wild after one of the numbers.  I’ve said very little about the plot, since layers are revealed during the course of the play. Part of the thrill of the show is discovering where the actions of the lead character are leading. If you can get a ticket, see it. Even more importantly, if you have kids, drag them to it. They’ll squirm at times, as will you, because of the frankness of the parent/child dynamic, but in the long run all of you will appreciate it.  Side note: This production has one of the best marketing ploys I have seen for Broadway. The artwork for the production features an image of Evan Hansen (sans face) prominently displaying the cast that he wears through much of the play. So what do they do when they sell you the window card (poster) in the lobby? They give you a souvenir Sharpie so that you can wait at the stage door and get the cast to sign your cast. Genius.	26	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Broadway at It's Best	CharlesLaBorde
35	January 21, 2017	"Sure, Ben Platt is exceptional in the lead role, and the show does focus on 'of the moment' topic, bullying, but as someone else commented, this is a poor ""Next To Normal"".  The supporting cast was as good as the best high school production and when you can guess what words are coming next in each song, because they've tried so hard to rhyme, it offers hope for any aspiring lyricist.  If this is your starter for serious Broadway musicals, just know it gets so much better."	29	3	Dear Evan Hansen	If You Love Great High School Musicals	dbalex
3	February 1, 2017	"We both loved it. I would definitely not suggest this for anyone younger than 13. Three times, I cringed just because of the graphic language, but it passed quickly and my son didn't bring it up. You leave the theatre sort of exhausted, because it is a roller coaster of emotions. When it was over, I turned to him and said, ""What a beautiful musical."" Not for the ""Suzie Sunshine"" type crowd, but the acting is top notch. The two actresses that play the mothers are both incredible as is Ben Platt. Definitely a conversation starter. We see a fair number of shows, and I am selective about where I spend our hard earned money. This one was worth every dime. Especially if you have a teenage son or daughter...take them to see it. Anyone who appreciates stellar acting will also appreciate."	2	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Christmas Present for my 13 year old son!	Brake24
188	February 1, 2017	Emotionally intense, fantastic show! Ben Platt was exceptional, and the rest of the cast was superb. I have to admit, it was an emotional roller coaster and I was uncomfortable at times, due to the story line. It pulled me in and kept me riveted to the end. Ben Platt's performance is 5 Stars!!!	117	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Go see this show now!!	Knows
247	February 5, 2017	One of the most moving shows I've seen in a long time. Very heavy subject matter but handled so tastefully. Ben Platt gives a Tony award winning performance. I recommend this show for high school aged students and up. Bring tissues ! Wonderful score. 	65	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Buy Your Tickets Now!	jmbc04
950	December 17, 2016	I've been to over 50 Broadway shows over MANY years. This is one of the best shows ever! Not only is the singing fantastic but the acting is fabulous. The young man lead actor gave the single best overall performance I've ever seen. He literally brings the audience to tears (in a good way) throughput the show. You should see this soon because tickets will be very hard to get once word gets out about this event. Note, this is not a TYPICAL musical in many ways: ( a very small cast, no fancy costumes or extravagant dance numbers) THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST SEE.	221	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Truly amazing!	William S
102	December 22, 2016	WOW! That was the impression of everyone in my party after we saw the show. We saw it just a few days after opening, so had not heard much about it other than that we should see it. And yes: seeing this show was an excellent decision! Great writing, beautiful music. Bonus: Not a bad seat in the theater!	40	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Fantastically beautiful show.	kmaria1202
100	December 24, 2016	Heard good reviews of this show so got a ticket for my recent NYC trip. There seemed to be a lot of teens and pre-teens in the audience which is probably a good thing because the show delivers a message most of them likely need to hear: No one is invisible, no matter how much you think you may be, or even want to be. Sets were fairly simple and featured lots of screens projected with social media images. It was a well crafted show with catchy songs. The actors were amazing and the performance of Ben Platt was outstanding, one of the most emotionally wrenching performances I've ever seen in a Broadway show. Something even us far-from-being-a-teenagers can appreciate. Kudos.	33	4	Dear Evan Hansen	A well crafted, well acted show.	Steven W
32	January 1, 2017	This is the best show I have ever seen with some of the best performers I have ever seen, namely Ben Platt. His performance as Evan Hansen was so raw and honest, I had a hard time remembering he was only acting. The messages in this play are so important for students, their parents, and even teachers to hear. It is a story that is relatable to so many people, I wish every one of my students could see this play. I was surrounded by so many different people during the performance, and noticed that not a single one of them had a dry eye during certain songs, we all jumped out of our seats to give the cast and crew a standing ovation at the end. They all did a phenomenal job. Thank you SO much for sharing this with us! I hope I can see it again soon!	7	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Do yourself a favor and see this show!	Meaghan C
43	January 2, 2017	Great show, wonderful cast, incredible music. Must see. Expensive show but if you can splurge on one show it should be this one. Great for a more contemporary audience. If your looking for Rogers and Hammerstein classic it's not this and maybe something like Fiddler or Falsettos would be better. I would say this has high chances for a Tony award.  It is a great show with a wonderful message and with great value. You will leave inspired and filled with hope.	20	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Great show	j0pamby
156	January 5, 2017	Dear Evan Hansen, is truly a one of a kind show. It explores so many different complications really in everyones life, not fitting in. It also teaches an important lesson on social media. Ben Platt and Rachel Bay Jones along with the rest of the cast are beyond amazing. Highly recommend!!! Music is great!	138	5	Dear Evan Hansen	BRILLIANT.	cardtraveler
97	January 6, 2017	Other than seeing a few songs on youtube from Dear Evan Hansen, I had no idea what the show was about, other than there was amazing music. I'd recommend it to all ages and generations. The show is well cast, the songs are memorable, and the book poignant. Very thought provoking.	17	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Amazing Cast, Score, Book, Sets and Direction	GoBlueInGA
26	January 7, 2017	"I purchased tickets for this show because my daughter asked for them for Christmas. She said it is the next "" Hamilton ""! We saw Hamilton in Nov 2015 and it was amazing!  Honestly my daughter was 100% correct! Dear Evan Hansen was absolutely fantastic! We laughed and cried and were deeply moved. It is a beautiful and important show .... not to be missed! Ben Platt is mesmerizing!  We already got tickets to go again in April! "	16	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Christmas present for my daughter! 	KJaworski
26	January 9, 2017	Quite simply an amazing show. With the subject matter you wonder how it's not going to be a morbid affair but the reality is a powerful non stop production full of both humour and emotion in equal measure. Ben Platt's performance is top notch in the lead role. Must see show. 	8	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Simply fantastic	allleftfoot03
880	December 3, 2016	Dear Evan Hansen is a brand-new Broadway show - we saw it in previews but it officially opens tomorrow! Ben Platt plays the lead - he is marvelous. I have a feeling he will be nominated for a Tony for Best Actor in a Musical. The show is about a high school age boy who is awkward and trying to make his way. He tells a lie and then the lie grows and grows in significance. It's a really beautiful show; funny, poignant. The music is very engaging. The show is appropriate for anyone over the age of 12. This is not an old-fashioned type of Broadway musical - it is young, hip and very current in topic and style.	294	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Wonderful New Broadway Show	493Ron
98	December 7, 2016	Tough name. Don't let it fool you. I had one weekend in NYC. I was going to see one show. I researched and read and asked everyone I know. Aside from the impossible to get Hamilton, I had quite a list going and narrowing it down was hard. Dear Evan Hansen at the Music Box Theater is magnificent. It is musical and dramatic, an easy to follow production with a small dynamic cast in a beautiful old theater. It is about a group of highschool students. They are each struggling in their own way. One of them takes his own life. A note is found but the note is misunderstood by the parents. Hence begins a relationship/friendship with another teen who is also an outcast of sorts. This show is hard to describe because it may sound depressing but it was not. It was real and sensitive and palpable and even funny. This incredible cast earned a standing ovation and lost of tears at the end - of happiness.	67	5	Dear Evan Hansen	One of the best shows I have ever seen!	Readingandeating
8	December 10, 2016	Dear Evan Harris is a must see! Ben Platt, best known for his role in Pitch Perfect, is brilliant! 	3	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Dear Evan Harris - Broadway	Cheri B
68	June 26, 2018	We had balcony seats, and we were very pleased. The theater is tiny, so there aren’t many “bad” seats. The performers were unbelievable, and the show was superb. The concessions are VERY limited, so eat before you go. After the show the performers came out and signed playbills on the street, which was great. I highly recommend this show-5 stars!!!	23	5	Dear Evan Hansen	AMAZING show...in my top 5 of all time!	Jennifer M
57	June 29, 2018	The show was entertaining throughout. The smallish theatre made the performance feel intimate and while the subject matter could have been considered dark the young cast made it feel very contemporary and even uplifting. Performances were first rate and it was definitely worth seeing. The Music Box Theater was a great venue.  All in all a memorable night.	15	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Very entertaining	Debbie D
163	July 1, 2018	We enjoyed the music, story, flow and actors. A definite much see of theatre in NYC. located in the heart of times square.	28	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Very enjoyable musical and great story	Michael H
280	July 26, 2018	Dear Evan Hansen is the most emotional piece of theater I have ever watched. I laughed, I cried, but more importantly, I related to so many of the characters in different ways. Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, will find a connection to at least one of the characters. I could relate as mom, a wife, a daughter with divorced parents, and a high schooler (even though that was many years ago). When I met back up with my husband afterwards and tried to explain it to him, I broke down hysterically crying as I explained the 2nd to last scene when Evan's mom Heidi, sings to him. This musical touched my heart and soul, and I will never forget it. The music and actors are fantastic. This show is a MUST SEE for everyone and I cannot wait to see it again, hopefully soon.	133	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Beyond Amazing!	BaseballFan5
418	August 1, 2018	We have been trying to get tickets and when they opened up a few more months we grabbed tickets for a Tuesday night. It was sold out. The characters were great and tackled a difficult topic which made you feel uncomfortable at times, as well as tears and laughter but so true to life. The lead played by Taylor Trensch was excellent but I loved Mallory Bechtel who played Zoe Murphy. To think she just graduated high school and this was her debut performance. So worth seeing.	164	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Still going strong	Karen C
119	August 6, 2018	Fantastic play. Great contemporary story. Beautiful songs. Superb acting. Funny. Thought-provoking. Topical. My teenage daughter’s favorite. A clear dont miss. 	35	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Fantastic!!!	TMish2014
22	August 6, 2018	I was completely blown away by this show. The content is intense, but the writers and cast had a way of conveying a humorous tone through parts of the play so it lightened the mood at times. However, don’t let me fool you - you will need tissues, and plenty of them. I don’t think there was a dry eye in the theater. The music was amazing and the messages of the performance seemed to hit a note with everyone in the theater. This is a must see. Simply amazing.	7	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Unbelievable Performance	bb_travel18
1783	August 10, 2018	In a lifetime of theater-going, few plays have so completely captivated me. The Pasek and Paul songs are hauntingly beautiful and inspirational in their messages. Ensemble acting is effective and engaging. Sets and staging technology are imaginative.  I have heard others react negatively to the theme of teenage suicide as the subject of a musical. Precisely, that is part of the greatness of the play. It takes on an important and difficult subject and addresses it masterfully. I would advise parents and grandparents taking teenage or young adult offspring to the play, to discuss the issue of suicide before and after. Surrounded by such mature family communication, seeing “Dear Evan Hansen” together should be a healthy and even therapeutic experience for all in the family.  Any way you do it, “Dear Evan Hansen” is a great experience of the theater. It is what the art of theater ought to be at its best. 	743	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Among the Very Best Plays Ever	Mark W
43	August 12, 2018	We had heard so much about this musical, and it was really excellent, but perhaps left me expecting more. I had seen Come From Away, which was one of my all time favourite musicals, and when Dear Evan Hansen had beaten it out for the Tony last year I thought this must be really incredible. I would highly recommend people see it, as it is extremely well done, great acting, captivating story line, fantastic musical numbers. I just felt it didn't come close to the impact Come From Away had on me. Still .. a wonderful show!	17	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Excellent Musical	JohnM_Bathurst
5	April 8, 2018	This show is incredibly moving but makes you laugh out loud all at once. It stays with you long after the show ends. Tickets were expensive, but it was well worth the price.	1	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Brings you to tears, in the best way	Caroline S
15	March 27, 2018	FANTASTIC!!! Probably some's it up. After a long day and flight into NYC we had a 7 pm show. My concern was being able to stay up after over 18 hrs. on the go. Neither of us blinked an eye. The show was riveting and the actors were phenomenal. A must see.	5	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Dear Evan Hansen	Ron K
56	March 27, 2018	A wonderful story by a fabulous cast! If you are going to be in NYC, I highly recommend. My husband, our 15-year old daughter and I went to see the Wednesday matinee. We all were equally amazed and impressed with the story and the entire cast. We would LOVE to see it again! (Fair warning: There are sexual innuendos and foul language for those with younger children.)	24	5	Dear Evan Hansen	What a FANTASTIC show!	Christine K
2	March 28, 2018	This was one of my favorite shows. Not because the music was so memorible, but for other reasons. First, almost every seat in the Music Box Theatre is good. The performances, across the board, were all good. The story was fresh and meaningful. The musical moves along at a good pace (many times on Braodway, you like parts of a show, but other parts drag along and you lose focus, understandably. My kids enjoyed the show, too. 	2	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Dear Evan Hansen	bpred
13	March 29, 2018	Dear Evan Hansen now stands as my favorite Broadway show ever. The content and message is a must see for every teen and parent. My 16 year old daughter and I planned this for months. It was simply an awesome experience.	1	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Worth every penny!	Ramona B
874	March 29, 2018	What can I say? It has all been said. FANTASTIC! TERRIFIC! MEANINGFUL! This show deserves every award it has won!	445	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Brought me to tears several times.	stevewilhite
101	April 1, 2018	Dear Evan Hansen lives up to every bit of the hype I’d heard! It’s something any parent of a teenager will be impacted by- and certainly relate to. Make sure to bring plenty of tissues- you will need them in various parts of the show. The set is absolutely amazing, and moves from scene to scene flawlessly, while displays from the likes of social media sites, texts, and other teen “vices” are projected ( changes up a bit) throughout. The characters are wonderful, and so much of what occurs in the story ( during no the show) is relatable to parents, teens ( DEFINITELY OLDER TEENS, mature subject matter and some very heavy scenes make this not quite suitable for the teen,early teen set) and perfectly captures the dynamics between the parent/teen relationship, but every bone chilling fear that every parent carries with them about their own child. Relatable to the teens as well, as much of the teen dynamic portrayed parallels what our teens experience daily. RUN, DONT WALK OR WAIT TO GET TICKETS! Worth every cent!	45	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Amazing show!! Completely relatable with today’s teens	Jwolff70
118	April 3, 2018	This is an amazing musical which deals with mental health. It is funny, emotional and thought provoking. I can see why it won so many awards. The cast are all fantastic. Bravo. 	28	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Winner	Strictly2
62	April 5, 2018	This was an absolutely lovely show to go see with my 17-year old son and my husband. We had a great time. At first I was a little anxious, at it seemed to be a little slow, but the plot twist came soon enough that transformed the play and made the human stories very palpable and relatable. We laughed, we cried. This was absolutely memorable and a must-do!	15	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Moving and funny all at once	bedandy
253	April 6, 2018	The presenters well understand intra-family and intra-teen dynamics. The cast and staging are first-rate and the music unobtrusive but excellent.  The whole effect, alas, invoked a sadness about protagonists in no way admirable, just pitiable. They create fantasy worlds about lives just as empty as the ones they’re actually living. Different, but no better.	82	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Triggers Emotions, Discourages Thoughts 	BillyReyn
140	May 16, 2018	We wanted to see this show last year when we visited, but tickets were so hard to come by we waited (it still sells out well in advance). This play's enduring popularity is impressive. With a cast of only eight actors, they give a delightful performance.	16	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Enjoyed this thoroughly	Jim N
105	April 16, 2018	I have had DEH on rotation with Hamilton for months, so I thought I knew what to expect. I wasn't ready! Teen suicide, social anxiety, lies, parents who are doing their best.... There were tears onstage and in the audience.  The actors were fabulous and the sound system at The Music Box presented every note clearly. If you are taking teens, make sure you have a discussion before and after.	22	5	Dear Evan Hansen	I thought I was prepared	Locemup
80	April 18, 2018	We went to see this with our teenage children (16 and 14) and we all thought it was absolutely brilliant. Tickets were expensive but worth every penny. The whole cast was fantastic, the story and the songs had us captivated from start to finish. Probably one of the best plays I have ever seen. Very moving. Stays with you. Topical and highly recommended.	28	5	Dear Evan Hansen	DO NOT MISS!	Guyleroiuk
2	April 30, 2018	An amazing, brilliant, relatable broadway show on every level. I laughed and cried through throughout the entire thing. I didn't want it to end. Just perfect. A MUST see!	80	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Brilliant	Rachel H
326	May 5, 2018	It is a musical so you will get some nice music well performed both by the actors and by the orchestra ‘in the sky’.  Unfortunately amongst songs and talks , there were a lot of shouting matches which, in my view did not relate to art or to a normal day to day behaviour ... On the other hand you go to a musical in order to get a sort of joy or something similar but this show just reflects a kind of fake reality or fake relationships among teenagers and adults  The extra show of the simulated auction at the end did not mitigate the percetipon of fake , on the contrary ! One wonders about the criteria used by those granting the awards; maybe they intended to rise a flag the slippery slope facing the new generations... Anyway one thing you wont forget : the price of the tickets	109	3	Dear Evan Hansen	Bearable	Cetatzeni
19	May 6, 2018	The story reflects the struggle of growing up in today’s young society..... my daughter and I had a similar conversation on the drive to the train....it’s so hard to explain the consequences of making emotional decisions...mainly because we have all done this and the lessons are so valuable. That is what Dear Evan Hansen is... it brings out the impact of this, touches on the reality of teen suicied, anxiety, popularity, and parental struggle throwing in Social Media.... a big thumbs up...loved that bit of reality, more importantly loved that it’s relatable to current day youth struggle..	9	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Sometimes things just hit home.....	Meanglani
401	May 20, 2018	We’d wanted to see Dear Even Hansen for some time and had our opportunity on a recent trip. Our seats were great and the venue somewhat small so most seats seemed like hey would be good. Prices were not bad.  The cast was awesome and the musical score and songs catchy. The theme of the show had a definite seriousness to it. Fortunately there is plenty of comic relief. You’ll leave the theatre feeling good however. I highly recommend Dear Evan Hansen. 	117	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Serious topic with comic relief and great music	Kenneth P
15	May 20, 2018	I cannot recommend Dear Evan Hansen because of the way it addresses teenage suicide. While I commend songwriter Benj Pasek for wanting to share his high school experience about his classmate's drug overdose, I disagree with creating a comedy about Benj's observation of how teenagers compete with each other to prove their level of grief when they were not friends with the young man who died. While this could have been addressed as a strange cultural phenomenon, it overshadowed the opportunity to tell a story that could have helped educate kids on more sensitive ways to handle the tragedy of teen suicide. Dear Evan Hansen could have told the story of how one teenager helped his/her peers address suicide with love and compassion.	31	1	Dear Evan Hansen	Lack of Sensitivity re: Teen Suicide	PAFamilyTravel
1041	May 28, 2018	I have been listening to this soundtrack for the past 6 months so was excited to finally see the show on Broadway during a recent business trip. Very comfortable theatre. Good show with a good message. I also really liked the new guy (Taylor) that is playing Evan.	310	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Great show	John S
5	May 29, 2018	DEH was an amazing musical from all aspects- the acting, singing, use of technology, and storyline all reel you in. This great story of a lonely boy who gains fame and acceptance through one small lie that causes a chain reaction through social media is one that everyone can relate to. There are times when I was laughing at the top of my lungs and moments when I was uncontrollably crying. This musical gives a very important message of not only how powerful technology can be but also how powerful human interactions are. Taylor Trensch plays a great Evan, and the rest of the cast is just as phenomenal. Seating is decent from most sides. I was in the middle and more towards the back, but I enjoyed the performance just fine. This is definitely worth the watch.	6	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Amazing Combination of People and Technology	Jannatul A
33	May 30, 2018	Dear Evan Hansen was amazing, everyone should see it. I've been wanting to see it for the longest time and I finally got to see it by getting a Standing Room ticket when the box office opened. It was totally worth it!	11	5	Dear Evan Hansen	So good	Amparo P
162	June 6, 2018	A must see. Perfect music, story, acting, and cast. An emotional roller coaster for sure but so worth every second.	40	5	Dear Evan Hansen	A must see.	cln96
76	June 12, 2018	Yes, it's a tearjerker, but has so many amazing funny and empowering moments from every single cast member. It's because the characters are so fully realized and not just played for sentiment that this show is so powerful. The staging & lighting are incredible.	26	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Bring all the Kleenex	Kris W
73	June 15, 2018	Went to see Dear Evan Hansen on the recommendation of a friend and was very happy to have done so. It's tough to succinctly summarize as it touches on so many serious topics: suicide and the guilt it leaves in it's wake, social acceptance, lies, family turmoil, young love... This is a very small, capable cast and each of these characters is flawed and struggling. What is thought to be at first glance is not what actually is. Luckily there is a fair amount of humor to put everybody at ease as the story weaves to it's more upbeat conclusion. The actors and music made this show a very emotional experience and the set was simple yet amazing. The Music Box Theater was on the smaller side which made our row N Orchestra seats feel nice and close. The leg room was pretty good but the seats were not that comfortable after sitting for the entire performance--definitely stretch during intermission. Would absolutely recommend you get tix for Dear Evan Hansen.	13	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Nice Balance of Drama and Comedy	MrsSunsh1ne
13	June 15, 2018	My youngest son and I went to see Dear Evan Hansen this week. It's a great show. The story is a compelling human interest story that makes you laugh and cry. I don't want to spoil it, but it addresses issues that everyone will confront in their lives. The language is a little strong in parts, but I thought it was fine for my 11 year old as he hears that stuff at school every day. Anyone who has ever struggled to fit in, or parents who have struggled with a challenging child will certainly be able to relate to this story. Definitely worth seeing and it elicited some great conversation with my youngest son.	7	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Real Emotional Connection - Makes You Laugh and Cry	Brian M
40	June 18, 2018	The story in this play is so relatable to anyone who sees the show. It is so realistic and something that could definitely happen in today's high school world. It is very hard to explain the plot of the play, but the acting was absolutely amazing and the music was great!! The theater is very small which explains the high cost of the tickets, but we sat in the balcony and I can tell you that there is not a bad seat in the house. You are easily able to see the facial expressions of the actors and most of the acting takes place at the front of the stage. If you are going to be in NY, definitely do not miss this show!!	25	5	Dear Evan Hansen	One of the best Broadway shows I've ever seen!!!	rmr23
675	May 6, 2018	I waited a year to see this show so the tickets were available somewhere other than By people reselling. It was so worth the wait. My husband I have seen a lot of plays- this is a great one. A good message yes, but not so heavy handed that it hit you in the face. Sometimes life goes wrong, but keep on going anyway. The raw and frequent emotions are well performed and the vocal are great too. Simply extraordinary! 	193	5	Dear Evan Hansen	Loved it!	Micky O
44	May 7, 2018	"I watched this with my 12 year old daughter. She would give it 5 stars as she said it was one of the best, if not the best musical she has seen. For me however, it was very good, but not the best. I get what everyone is talking about. The show is great, the story is relevant to today's younger society, and the talent is awesome. You will laugh and cry, and you will be entertained, but I can also agree with some of the negative reviews in some ways.  Personally, I liked the first half much better than the second half. Perhaps this is because the ending left me feeling a bit dissatisfied. It is neither a happy ending, nor is there really any closure. Of course, this is an illustration of the ""life goes on"" philosophy, but it leaves you feeling neither triumphant nor joyful. Yet it doesn't feel tragic or impactful as much as the first half did for me. But this is the story and how it plays out. I was also slightly underwhelmed with the performance itself. I listened to the soundtrack before seeing the show and Ben Platt's voice was a little flat for our show and he seemed to struggle to hit the high falsetto notes this night.  I think my daughter enjoyed it more than me because of the relevance it had to her and the social circles that she engages in. Also, the emotions hit her harder than they did me. So between her and I, this show gets 4 stars overall. It is definitely entertaining and filled with talent though. And although the story is good, it leaves me wanting a little more closure. Then again, that's life eh? Bottom line, we recommend this show but would not see it again."	35	4	Dear Evan Hansen	Entertaining and Talented-Filled	Michael K
